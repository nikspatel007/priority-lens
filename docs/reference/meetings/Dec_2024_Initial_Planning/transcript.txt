00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Nik Patel: Hello.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Josh Smith: Oh, hey, Nick, how you doing, man?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Nik Patel: Good, um, sorry for being late, just been back-to-back last couple hours.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Josh Smith: It's alright, man.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Nik Patel: You feeling okay? You sound different.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, man, I've been… I've been pretty sick since I got back from a conference in Boston.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Nik Patel: Uh…

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Nik Patel: Alright, well, hopefully this weekend's the weekend you get all the rest and get back to, uh, whatever normal means for you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I learned that if you go back to a conference… if you go to a conference, it's gonna be a super spreader event of some sort.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Nik Patel: Yes. What was the conference about?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, it was for, um…

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Josh Smith: Red Rover, uh, company I'm with right now, um…

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Nik Patel: Oh, you work for Red Rover?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Nik Patel: Oh, nice! Mike Sheldon, right? Like, that's the Mike Sheldon and, like, quite a few frontliners there?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Josh Smith: So, there was a… I'm working on their professional development product.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Nik Patel: Got it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Josh Smith: And, uh, I went to a National Learning Forward Conference in Boston. It's professional growth, professional learning.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Josh Smith: For K-12 district leaders, so, um.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I went up there for 3 days, Monday to Wednesday, to just gather intel.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Josh Smith: Um, and, um, I came back with…

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Josh Smith: This. Oh, yay!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Nik Patel: That…

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Josh Smith: Wonderful.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nik Patel: Oh, man. Um…

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Josh Smith: You were, uh, you were out too.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Nik Patel: I was in San Francisco, yes, um…

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Nik Patel: For what it's worth, it was a good…

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Nik Patel: a good couple days. I was there only for, like, 2 days. We had this, like, Gartner workshop. We are…

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Nik Patel: the team that I'm working in, we are building an AI accelerator.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Nik Patel: And, uh, we got a decent size of funding, or decent enough, uh.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Nik Patel: for what I would consider good. We asked for more. We asked for, like, 10 million for next year. They gave us 6 million, which…

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Nik Patel: It's better than zero?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Nik Patel: Um, and then from 27 onwards, they are committing to 10 million per year, so…

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Nik Patel: we were, like, all happy that we got the funding, but now it's… it's one of those startup moments. It's like, oh, I got the… I got the funding, and we invested in me, and the next moment is like, oh, what am I supposed to do with this money, and…

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Nik Patel: How do I make sure that this money actually shows some value, right? So…

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Nik Patel: We were just, uh, discussing through that, and had, like, a workshop and, um, team celebration event and stuff like that, but yeah, it was… it was pretty fun.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Josh Smith: Awesome, congrats!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Nik Patel: Thank you, it's, uh… it's been a bunch… lots of work. Well, actually, funny enough.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Nik Patel: I have had worse days trying to get smaller things approved for like $5,000 and $50,000 than it took me to get 6 million, so…

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Nik Patel: It's funny in a way.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, oh, reminds me of…

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Josh Smith: you know, one thing I learned really early on in business, uh, when I was…

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Josh Smith: Doing contract photography work is that…

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, when I charge a low amount, like, all my low deals, like.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Josh Smith: You know, $100 to $1,000 deals.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Josh Smith: The customers were always the piggiest.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes, yep.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Josh Smith: And the fussiest. And…

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Josh Smith: Always just put you through the wringer, and…

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Josh Smith: Made you work for every dollar.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Josh Smith: But when I had clients that charged me, like, 5, 10K.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Josh Smith: They were like, I'm paying you because I trust you, and I know you're gonna do the work, and I expect you to do, so I'm gonna be hands-off.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, just, uh, make sure you deliver, yeah. Those are the best.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Josh Smith: Make sure you deliver. And it's just like…

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Josh Smith: Why is it so… why is it so much harder for those lower amounts with these people, when the folks that have tons of money, when they.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Josh Smith: They kind of like just hand it to you and they're like.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Josh Smith: Get it done. Yeah.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Nik Patel: Uh, yeah, it's such an irony, in a way.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Nik Patel: Um… okay. So, to, I think, catch you up a little bit on…

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Nik Patel: I did not have a chance to do any hands-on yet.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Nik Patel: I'm hoping I can actually get to it this weekend, now that I'm back.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Nik Patel: But, um, did look into some of the options on what's out there for.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Nik Patel: voice agents, what can we use? Like, what might be some good options?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Nik Patel: I just need to play with them, see what happens.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Nik Patel: then I was starting to look into…

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Nik Patel: animations for waveform. So, like, when someone talks, like, how do we show that waveform, and how do we make it look good, and all that.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Nik Patel: 11Labs has some React components already built.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Nik Patel: I'm seeing, like, if anyone has React Native components, not much out there, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal either. There are, like, some tutorials out there that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Nik Patel: That shows how you can make it look nicer, so at least that's good.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Nik Patel: Um… then I got into this whole…

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Nik Patel: uh, rabbit hole yesterday on the websites, and how much of the website is just, like, a static page versus, like, with some 3D animation that actually.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Nik Patel: Tells the story a little bit better.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Nik Patel: Um, so I did see, like, some websites, like, alright, this…

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Nik Patel: It's an amazing way to tell a story, where it's more visual and less words, and that felt pretty good, and to me, actually, even on brand.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Nik Patel: So, then I started thinking about, can we do any animation as part of the app?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Nik Patel: Went into seeing, uh, Lottie and…

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Nik Patel: Skia and, like, some other animation frameworks out there, and was thinking, like, could we use any of that to, like.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Nik Patel: Somehow show some meaningful onboarding.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Nik Patel: Um, and then went into messaging and, like, spent hours on messaging, just going back and forth on how I want to talk about it, which is what I ended up sending you.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Nik Patel: So that's been… that's been my update.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Nik Patel: The other thing I'd say, I don't have my phone on me right now, but…

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Nik Patel: Oh, do I… do you mind if I record the call?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, good, man.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Nik Patel: the, uh, the gesture that I had, um, I had built with the, um, uh, To-do app, heads up.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Nik Patel: where I can, like, do double tap on the phone, and it basically opened a voice mode, uh, is turning out to be a habit-forming.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Nik Patel: Uh, thing, actually. So, anytime I think about a task, now I'm actually starting to, like, just look for a phone and tap, tap, talk.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Nik Patel: And then I'm done.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Nik Patel: I created…

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Nik Patel: an interesting way to get to it without even a double tap, which is, I would essentially call, hey Siri, heads up.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Nik Patel: heads up is the app name. So as soon as they say, hey, Siri, heads up, uh, it essentially OP… it…

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Nik Patel: Siri sends me an intent on the app to say, like, something needs to happen, and when that intent comes through, I'm literally just opening up a voicemail, and you can start talking.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Nik Patel: So, even with Siri, I found a way to, like, not need to touch anything and still, like, go through it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Nik Patel: And the reason I was interested in that is, um, I've been…

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Nik Patel: trying to get onto this, like, note takers, I'm sure you have seen this, devices that are, like.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Nik Patel: Note-taker devices, where you could, like, record the meeting, record the call, and…

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Nik Patel: Not like the ones that you virtually onboard, but it's something that's like an actual physical device that you could take anywhere with you.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Nik Patel: Um, so I bought one, I've been trying to sort of, like.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Nik Patel: Push myself to use it more.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Nik Patel: But it's like, when I need it, where is the device, and what am I supposed to do with it?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Nik Patel: And what's been easier, or would have been easier, is my phone's always with me.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Nik Patel: So if I… if I could somehow, like, provide that intent to a phone that it's time.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Nik Patel: Right? Uh, and it starts recording, that's the best I can expect.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Nik Patel: So let's say I'm in a meeting, and I'm, like, at a dinner, and we are talking about something. It's like, oh, this is a great conversation.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Nik Patel: Hey, CD, um, ask head stub.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Nik Patel: Ask Priority Lens to start recording.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Nik Patel: And then, next thing you know, right, it just does it, and from there on, it creates the notes and does everything.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Nik Patel: within the priority lens, like, okay, now we are getting the context that I wouldn't have…

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Nik Patel: Gotten just by doing integrations.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, so that's something I started thinking through as well.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Nik Patel: And that's pretty much as far as I got last week.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Nik Patel: Still no coding, but the week's not over yet, so we'll see.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Josh Smith: Well, you still appear to have made quite a number of advancements?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I guess.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Nik Patel: I did want to really do some coding while I was away, because that would have been the time where.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Nik Patel: No other responsibilities, just in the hotel room, knock it out. It just didn't work out like that, so… bit bummed by that, but hey, we can still hear, and I…

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Nik Patel: I have a feeling we're gonna push it through, and we'll get something done.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, of course. And, um… hey, I'm on, um…

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Josh Smith: I'm on your time and pacing, so…

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Josh Smith: Let's…

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Josh Smith: In this time.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Josh Smith: Let's first make sure…

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Josh Smith: We get down a scheduled weekly cadence of connection.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Josh Smith: Unless you prefer…

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Josh Smith: extemporaneous.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Josh Smith: Connection, but…

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Nik Patel: I… I think it's good to have something on the calendar, um…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Nik Patel: But likely, chances that if it's during the day, um, we might have to, like, shift around, depending on how the day is going for both of us.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Josh Smith: Let's do, um…

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Josh Smith: Are you, uh… are you more of a Monday, Wednesday, or Tuesday, Thursday, or…

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Josh Smith: Wednesday, Friday…

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Nik Patel: So, Friday works…

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Nik Patel: Pretty much 90% of the time, just mainly because others are not working Fridays, which.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Nik Patel: Which means I can. Uh…

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Nik Patel: Mmm… let's see.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Nik Patel: So, normally, I do have this 5 to 6pm meeting with, um…

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Nik Patel: With one of the client every day.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Josh Smith: Every day.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Nik Patel: Uh, every weekday, yeah.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Josh Smith: Alright, fun.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I mean, they're West Coast, so it's like, oh, it's 3PM for me, and it's like, fair, it's 3PM for you, you know? It also makes it easy, because I think I can, like.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Nik Patel: Bit more, uh, available there.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Nik Patel: I'm checking my schedule, the good part is I'm expecting my schedule to, like.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Nik Patel: Be more open, at least for next couple weeks, as people start to, like, head out for vacation.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Nik Patel: So, what… what time would work for you, if we were to chat through things?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Nik Patel: Because you're Eastern, right? So you're even ahead…

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Nik Patel: An hour ahead of me.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Nik Patel: I'm curious if there is, like, a…

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Nik Patel: Evening's better for you, morning's better for you, um…

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Nik Patel: If afternoons, we just have to find some time and make sure I can stick to it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Josh Smith: take a look at your schedule. We'll do a Friday.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Josh Smith: And… a Tuesday or a Wednesday.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Nik Patel: I will… in that case, I will probably pick Wednesday.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Josh Smith: Wednesday. Alright.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. So, um, that said, on 24th.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Nik Patel: We are picking up a new car, so…

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Nik Patel: that might get a little shaky, that's the 24th, so it's Christmas Eve, and I'm not sure if you're working that day to begin with.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Nik Patel: But at least let's… let's nail down next week, and then week after, I think we have to just adjust to holiday schedules and stuff like that.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, if we did… our Wednesday-Friday cadence would be…

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Josh Smith: Would need to shift for next week and the week after.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Josh Smith: Uh, for that Wednesday, because that's New Year's Eve, too.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Nik Patel: New Year's Eve, exactly.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, your Christmas Eve and your New Year's Eve.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yep.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Josh Smith: Good old Saturnalia.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Josh Smith: You ever heard of that?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Josh Smith: No? Yeah.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Nik Patel: Now, that said, um, we started Tumble Leaf.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Nik Patel: with Ye, and we've been, like, watching it every day. It's pretty good, actually. I like it, I like watching it, too. It's like, oh, this is a good way for me to, like.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Josh Smith: What'd you think?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Nik Patel: Talk to him about something, an object, or… we saw, like, kite and torch, and, you know.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Nik Patel: All sorts of things, and it's like, this is pretty good.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Josh Smith: Oh, awesome! Dude, I loved it. I was so happy it was… it was around when my boys were young, because, yeah, I'm like, oh…

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I like it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Josh Smith: They're, I mean objects and.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Josh Smith: They're, it's slow and it teaches them things about using objects and.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Yep.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. That's cool.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Josh Smith: Um… glad it worked. Um…

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Josh Smith: What about somewhere between…

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Josh Smith: 4 and 6 CT PM.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Josh Smith: On Wednesday and Friday as a normal cadence.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Nik Patel: I think it's probably gonna be 4…

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, next week I'll block 4 to 5, for sure.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Josh Smith: CT.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, CD. And then, um…

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Nik Patel: if I can move the other meeting, I could probably do all 4 to 6. Or, also, do you want to do 2 or 3 next week?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Josh Smith: Up to you. I'll do as many as…

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Nik Patel: why don't we shoot for 3? My goal is that by the time we get into Christmas week.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Nik Patel: Not Christmas week, like, by the time we get to Christmas, um, I have enough to be able to come out in the new year with, like, okay, I have built something.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Nik Patel: Because that's the week when I know no one's working, and I can essentially, like, go into my…

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Nik Patel: Code, code mode.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Wanna do a Monday, Wednesday, Friday next week?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, let's do that. Uh, Monday, 4 to 5.30 is…

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Nik Patel: Already, uh, taken, though.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Nik Patel: I will… well, I don't know if it's gonna work out.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Josh Smith: Well, how about 5… how about if, uh…

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Josh Smith: About, oh, your 4 to 5:30 is taken CT.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Nik Patel: See this taken, yeah.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Josh Smith: And how about your 5:30 to 6:30s?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that's fine. Anytime after 5.30, I'll make it work.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Josh Smith: Well, let's do a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 5:30 to 6:30. How does that feel?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Nik Patel: Oh, no. Uh, so Monday 5.30 to 6.30, I think Wednesday 4 to 5.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Nik Patel: And then Friday, uh, we are seeing 4 to 5 as well.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Josh Smith: Got it.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Josh Smith: Sound good?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Nik Patel: I think as I'm thinking about what we do next, it seems like we have a really good handle on.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Nik Patel: Well, let me put it that way.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Nik Patel: Ball's in my court to be able to actually build something and experience it.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Nik Patel: Have you… have you tried Google AI Studio yet?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Josh Smith: No.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Nik Patel: It's probably worth trying for prototyping. Might be… might be pretty cool.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Nik Patel: I'll give it a try, though. I can tell you how it goes anyway.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Nik Patel: What it is, is, like, similar to using Figma, you could essentially say, these are my screens.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Nik Patel: And then, with a button, it will convert that into a prototype for you, that you can, like, start using.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Josh Smith: Really?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Nik Patel: Supposedly, yeah. I haven't gone too deep, but I've seen some people that.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Nik Patel: That I trust using it that way, uh, product people, so we'll see.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Josh Smith: Google Design Studio.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Nik Patel: AI Studio.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Josh Smith: Google AI Studio.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'll take a look.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Nik Patel: Fantastic.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Nik Patel: So then I think, um…

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Nik Patel: What we… assuming that we have the onboarding flow done as is.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Nik Patel: Or we just stick to it for now. We need to figure out what our, um…

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Nik Patel: Dashboards, and rest of the day-to-day.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Nik Patel: systems would look like for MVP.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Nik Patel: I think we get that done, and we'll be in a really, really good spot.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Do you want to… so, how about next week, we focus on conversations around defining that?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Yep. So that… and then, um, you had mentioned just, like.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Nik Patel: So, a couple things, which is more around.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Nik Patel: branding, style guides, basic stuff that I can, like, use for something.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Nik Patel: You had mentioned elevator pitch and something we could do together. I could use some help there as well, and uh…

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Nik Patel: I think that's…

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Nik Patel: Putting plenty, um…

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Nik Patel: for what we want to get done in December.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Nik Patel: I understand it might be a little bit more than what the scope was, so I'm happy to be flexible on the cost, too.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Josh Smith: It's fine. Let's… let's get through… let's get through this time.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Josh Smith: Work together.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Josh Smith: Um, let's keep it at the cost it is.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Nik Patel: Okay, appreciate it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Josh Smith: I wanna make sure…

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Josh Smith: I care about the alignment between…

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Josh Smith: The working cadence…

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Josh Smith: the cost.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Josh Smith: Perception of value from you. If that feels good.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Josh Smith: Then it's something we can discuss at the end of the month and see, you know.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Josh Smith: If that's an arrangement you'd want to…

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Josh Smith: Continue on a monthly basis, or if it's an arrangement you want to use any given month, you want to say, uh…

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Josh Smith: I don't need Josh to talk January, I need February, though. And then we can… we can go from there, but…

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Josh Smith: I'm, um, totally, yeah, it's all good.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Nik Patel: Okay, perfect, appreciate it. And yeah, I think it does seem like there will be something that I'd, uh, probably…

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Nik Patel: have every month that we… I could use your help on, but we'll know once I get through at least the first phase and how people react to it.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Nik Patel: it's getting to that point, I think, is the most important part.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Nik Patel: Um, as we are thinking through that, the other thing that's probably important is the perception of security, perception of.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Nik Patel: Privacy and stuff like that, sort of, like, built into this experience, where…

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Nik Patel: They see it, uh, that would be useful.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Nik Patel: And two things that I had thought of that I would find pretty, uh, pretty helpful.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Nik Patel: is, um…

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Nik Patel: Giving them, like, weekly recaps on, like, this is how your week went, and this is what your next week.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Nik Patel: Coming up, looks like, as of blah date.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Nik Patel: As well as…

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Nik Patel: having an ability for… for them to have, like, that retro conversation, and like, this work, this is what I'm thinking through, that, like, having 5-10 minute conversation.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Nik Patel: Can set the week in a really good spot for the system to, like, continue to track and follow through.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Nik Patel: Um, one of the things that's been asked in the conversations is.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Nik Patel: how will you measure the value that you are providing? And I… it's like, well, you'll just know.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Nik Patel: But that… that doesn't go well in the enterprise setting, right?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Josh Smith: Well, this is… this… this is B2B?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Nik Patel: This is, right now, B2C, but we are gonna go in B2B with the team's approach.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Uh, is it… is it… is it B2C2B, in the sense that you get somebody working for a company who's using it.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, for their company.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Josh Smith: They talk to other folks, you've got multiple people in that company now using it.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Josh Smith: But they have personal accounts, and then they suddenly gets… IT gets word of it, and they're like, well, if y'all are using it, we might as well consolidate it under single account.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Josh Smith: Create a company level, org level account.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Josh Smith: B2C, B2C to B play. Okay.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Nik Patel: Yep, and it could go straight from B2B too, but the idea is that it's gonna come because users love it.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Josh Smith: It's like your Slack.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Nik Patel: Not because we are pushing for it just because we have salespeople.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Nik Patel: Uh, I… I'm more…

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Nik Patel: More leaning towards product should speak for itself, and when it does, the sales portion is much easier than sales trying to push it when people don't understand what we are selling.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Josh Smith: Yep, and those ins… sorry, keep going.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Nik Patel: Um, some…

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, some of the things that has come up is…

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Nik Patel: What do you call it?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Nik Patel: show me the amount of time I saved, because I didn't have to worry about meeting scheduling.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Nik Patel: prepping, uh, the amount of emails sent, stuff like that, and it's like, yeah, it all sounds good, but there has to be a bigger value that we could show somehow.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Nik Patel: That brought you focus, and…

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Nik Patel: you were able to get better outcomes because priority lens existed.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Nik Patel: I don't know what it means yet, but just something that I'm putting on back of your mind, so when you have a chance to think about it.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Nik Patel: Um, I think that's…

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Nik Patel: pretty much all I got next week, I think, is all about.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Nik Patel: Assuming that we are connected into at least emails and calendars, multiple emails, multiple calendars.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Nik Patel: How do we start to bring focus? How do we start to auto-draft, auto-response, auto-schedule.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Nik Patel: Put in, uh, put, like.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Nik Patel: Prep and brief… briefs in general.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Nik Patel: like, basic stuff like that, right? None of that is rocket science right now. Pretty much every big companies are even starting to do it.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Nik Patel: But I'm… their mindset has always been, like, transactional. You have this meeting coming up, and I'll show you what could we do.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Nik Patel: Um, we want to see… take, like, more holistic approach, which is more focused on.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Nik Patel: Focus, clarity…

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Nik Patel: Time, outcome people, stuff like that.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, I'll pause there, but that's where I think my mind goes.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, the multiple emails calendar, um…

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Josh Smith: That's gonna be fun. That… depending upon your priorities, that could be a conversation, um…

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Josh Smith: The week after next and into the, into the week after that, the last 2 weeks of December.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Josh Smith: Um, because the calendar, there's… there's potentially a lot of value out of.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Josh Smith: Out of that, um, but the, the experience of it needs to be really simple.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, overall, ensuring a perception of trust.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Josh Smith: Aligning it to the current design language of a lot of these existing AI tools in my view is like.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Josh Smith: Um, precision in the design but simplicity.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Yeah, don't make me think.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Josh Smith: just, um…

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Josh Smith: Nothing ostentatious, nothing no unnecessary embellishment.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Josh Smith: Yes, working through that. Articulating clear, uh, value, okay.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Josh Smith: If you're being asked to do that.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Josh Smith: Um… alright.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Josh Smith: We can go through some exercises there.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Josh Smith: Designing, um, you, you, you talked about daily, weekly summary, summarization.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, of some kind, something that, like, brings everything together for someone to say, okay, this was worth it, you know, this…

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Nik Patel: I'm glad I had priority lens.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm, and…

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Josh Smith: And you also talked about something I missed, um, which was, like, a 5-minute…

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Josh Smith: Start of the week. Is it the start of the week or end of the week?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Nik Patel: Yes. It's more so, like.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Nik Patel: Uh, could be either. Uh, it's more of, like, a retro conversation, alright, based on what's coming up, here's what I want you to pay attention to, here's what's on one mind.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Nik Patel: And, like, I can start to delegate some of that to priority lens, so then it's not a mental clutter in my mind.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Nik Patel: it's out, my mental bandwid's open, I can focus on something else.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Nik Patel: Um, we will talk more about it next week, but I've been sort of thinking about this.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Nik Patel: This whole concept of…

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Nik Patel: Um, some of this…

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Nik Patel: Conversations become, like.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Nik Patel: Instantaneous workflows that continues to run in the background.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Nik Patel: And even more, uh, people can, like, create their own best practices and can share amongst other users.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Nik Patel: So, could become a marketplace of, oh, I have built these agents, and this style of working really works, you're welcome to try it, and people can import and say.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Nik Patel: I want to do this, or I want to update it to my own work style.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Nik Patel: And what that does, it allows us to open up.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Nik Patel: many things that are considered good practices, but no one has time to actually implement any of those practices, right? Now we are saying we will implement it, you just have to follow it.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Nik Patel: It's, uh, it's basically…

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Nik Patel: Probably bad analogy, but if you try to create a diet plan for yourself, it generally doesn't go well, but if you have a coach that's giving you a diet plan and that's all you get to eat.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Nik Patel: it's easier to say, okay, well, I just have to agree to it, and I don't have to think about it.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Nik Patel: So, that is more… I… we'll see when it happens. I'm thinking it's more, like.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Nik Patel: post-MVP features, but I definitely see value in this. I'm basically getting inspiration from.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Nik Patel: uh, development community that is doing this with Cloud Code and building Cloud skills and agents and.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Nik Patel: Hey, here's what I built, someone give it a try, you'll love it, you know, how they open source things that works for them.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Nik Patel: Um, it is a simpler way for people to build a community and, like, continue to keep the momentum versus.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Nik Patel: I'm on my own.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Josh Smith: So, like…

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Josh Smith: Could I build an agent, um, just so I understand, I need to get in the weeds a little with examples.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Josh Smith: If I built an agent that trolled…

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Josh Smith: That was able to identify, um…

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Josh Smith: Identify, um…

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Josh Smith: annoying marketing…

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Josh Smith: Sequences and troll them and lead them on to the point that it frustrates them back and they never contact me again.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Josh Smith: I could put that up on…

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, have it, yeah. But, yeah, something like that, right? Like, the simpler things that people do today is…

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Nik Patel: they, like, auto-tag some of the emails, if you look at Superhuman and some of the other ones, even including Google.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Nik Patel: Google would automatically tag it to an update, or a shopping, or forum, or…

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Nik Patel: social or important into those categories on its own, right? I could simply say when the emails come up within this mindset, I want you to tag them and put them here, and here's what you need to do about it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Nik Patel: So, um, if you… if I'm starting to get…

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Nik Patel: let's say, as a leader, I get a bunch of cold inbounds, which I don't care about. I do not want to hear them.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Nik Patel: But if you see something along the lines of.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Nik Patel: Hey, this is how you can build an agent, because my team need to think through it, just let me know about it.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, like, it's… it's filtering everything out, but something that I care about actually gets…

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Nik Patel: in front of me is worth it. And then, it would be like, once you do that, I want you to research the company, I want you to look at XYZ things.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Nik Patel: ask them some follow-up questions, go through the follow-ups, and get me to a point where, when I look at it, the answer should include XYZ stuff.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Nik Patel: Because you have communicated with them, that's what I want.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Nik Patel: Right? And now it's essentially a workflow tool that I simply created, and it becomes the best practices on.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Nik Patel: whatever. Um, I'm making it up, but the idea is that I'm creating my, like.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Nik Patel: background workflows, uh, that I can, like, set in a way that makes sense for me.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Nik Patel: And from there on, I could hand it… others could use it, or at least I can use it in…

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Nik Patel: do something with it. I don't know what it will mean yet, but it… I think there is some value in it, we'll see.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Josh Smith: Alright, is this, like, is this… how is this related to creating rules?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Nik Patel: Um, very similar.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Nik Patel: Uh, it's natural language right now, so you're basically saying it in a natural language, and then we are converting them into rules that the system can execute.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Josh Smith: Alright, what's the difference between a rule and an agent?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Nik Patel: Um… rule is transactional, agent is long-running.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Josh Smith: Can you convert a role into an agent?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Nik Patel: Uh… possibly, yes.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Josh Smith: Possibly.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Nik Patel: Yep. So, um…

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Nik Patel: The rule is, when the email comes in, check it and apply a tag. That's a rule.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Nik Patel: An agent is, you need to check, um…

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Nik Patel: Like, every morning before I wake up, you need to create a daily brief, and here's what it needs to look like.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Nik Patel: Right? Anytime something comes up, if you see an email where there's a prospect, I want you to do the research on that person and, like.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Nik Patel: put that in my… in my… whatever people tab that we have, so that I'm starting to build my CRM and, like.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Nik Patel: starting to capture the data that could come handy for me later. Uh, show me insights that I did not know about. Like, those are more long-running.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Nik Patel: in the background, always executing type of things, versus rule is, I did this on an email, and then I'm not gonna think about that email ever.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Josh Smith: Got you.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Nik Patel: Um, but anyway, like I said, we could chat about it more next week, uh, and see where it goes.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Nik Patel: I'll put some more thoughts into what would make sense from a dashboard perspective, but this is where I'm really looking for.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Nik Patel: For your expertise to say, this is how we should structure it, this is how we make it easy, simple.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Nik Patel: and then convert that into UI components for us.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Nik Patel: Uh, mobile first, yep.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Josh Smith: Yep, that's gonna be fun.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Josh Smith: That's helpful information.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, when it comes to rule or agent in the language, if technically on the back end they're different, but on the front end…

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Josh Smith: Your users…

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Nik Patel: It's all agents, in a way.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Josh Smith: see them.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, if your users think of them as the same thing, it's just one of them's simple and the other's a bit more complex.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Josh Smith: It sometimes makes more sense to just call them the same thing.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, absolutely, yes. Um, in fact, there's this whole thing that we were talking about, right? Like, what do we call our assistant?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Nik Patel: That the voice assistant thing, and then it could be even just as simple as, like, hey, remember this, and then voice… voice assistant behind the scene creates the rules.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Nik Patel: But my entry point is always that, like, one person, and I never have to think about anything else. So, um…

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Nik Patel: I'm sure we could think about, like, ways where…

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Nik Patel: it's not overwhelming, it's simple, I'm talking to one thing, and that one thing knows everything.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Nik Patel: Regardless of how the system itself is developed.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Josh Smith: You too, I've captured… I've captured my own notes for this conversation that I will…

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Josh Smith: Uh, keep in mind for… yeah, when we meet next Monday.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
