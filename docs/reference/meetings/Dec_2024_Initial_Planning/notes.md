# Initial Planning Session

**Date:** Early December 2024 (Friday)
**Attendees:** Nik Patel, Josh Smith
**Duration:** ~34 minutes
**Topic:** Project Kickoff, Context Sharing, Working Relationship Setup

---

## Context & Background

### Josh's Current Work
- Works at **Red Rover** on their professional development product
- Just returned from **Learning Forward Conference** in Boston (National conference for K-12 district leaders on professional growth/learning)
- Attended Monday-Wednesday to gather intel on the professional development space
- Came back sick ("super spreader event")

### Nik's Current Work
- Just returned from **San Francisco** for a Gartner workshop
- Working on **AI Accelerator** project within his organization
- Received significant funding:
  - **$6 million for 2025** (asked for $10M)
  - **$10 million/year committed from 2027 onwards**
- Managing multiple contracts simultaneously (West Coast client with daily 5-6pm CT meetings)

### Shared Insight on Client Relationships
Both discussed the irony of client work:
> **Josh:** "When I charge a low amount, like $100 to $1,000 deals, the customers were always the piggiest and the fussiest... But when I had clients that charged me 5, 10K, they were like, I'm paying you because I trust you, and I know you're gonna do the work."

> **Nik:** "I have had worse days trying to get smaller things approved for like $5,000 and $50,000 than it took me to get 6 million."

## Nik's Progress Update

### Technical Exploration Completed
1. **Voice Agent Options** - Researched what's available for voice agents
2. **Waveform Animations** - Looked into showing visual feedback when someone talks
   - 11Labs has React components already built
   - React Native options limited, but tutorials exist
   - Explored Lottie and Skia animation frameworks
3. **3D Website Animations** - Fell into rabbit hole exploring animated storytelling websites
   - More visual, less words approach
   - Feels "on brand" for Priority Lens
4. **Messaging/Positioning** - Spent hours on how to talk about the product

### Heads Up App Breakthrough
Nik shared an important discovery from his existing "Heads Up" to-do app:

**Double-tap gesture becoming habit-forming:**
> "Anytime I think about a task, now I'm actually starting to just look for a phone and tap, tap, talk. And then I'm done."

**Siri Integration Discovery:**
- Created hands-free activation: "Hey Siri, heads up"
- Siri sends an intent to the app, which opens voice mode
- Allows recording without touching the phone

**Use Case Vision:**
> "Let's say I'm at a dinner, and we are talking about something. It's like, oh, this is a great conversation. Hey Siri, ask Priority Lens to start recording. And then, next thing you know, it just does it, and from there on, it creates the notes and does everything."

This solves the problem of dedicated note-taking devices (Nik bought one but phone is always more accessible).

## Working Arrangement

### Meeting Cadence Established
- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday** for the upcoming week
- **Wednesday and Friday** as regular cadence going forward
- Times: 4-5pm CT (except Monday at 5:30-6:30pm due to conflicts)
- Flexibility around Christmas/New Year holidays

### Compensation Discussion
Josh offered to keep costs at agreed rate despite potential scope expansion:
> "I care about the alignment between the working cadence, the cost, perception of value from you. If that feels good, then it's something we can discuss at the end of the month."

## Product Direction Discussion

### MVP Focus Areas
1. **Dashboards and day-to-day systems** - What does the daily experience look like?
2. **Multiple email/calendar integration** - Connect various accounts
3. **Auto-drafting, auto-response, auto-scheduling**
4. **Prep and briefs** for meetings

### Holistic Approach vs Transactional
> **Nik:** "Their mindset has always been transactional. You have this meeting coming up, and I'll show you what could we do. We want to take a more holistic approach, which is more focused on focus, clarity, time, outcome, people."

### Design Principles Discussed
- **Perception of security and privacy** built into the experience
- **Precision in design but simplicity**
- "Don't make me think"
- Nothing ostentatious, no unnecessary embellishment
- Trust-building through design language

### Feature Ideas

**Weekly Summaries:**
- Recap of how the week went
- Preview of what's coming up
- Show value being provided

**5-Minute Retro Conversations:**
> "Based on what's coming up, here's what I want you to pay attention to, here's what's on my mind. And I can start to delegate some of that to priority lens, so then it's not a mental clutter in my mind. It's out, my mental bandwidth's open, I can focus on something else."

## Rules vs Agents Discussion

This was a significant conceptual clarification:

### Rules (Transactional)
- Simple, one-time actions
- Example: "When an email comes in, check it and apply a tag"
- Fire and forget

### Agents (Long-Running)
- Continuous background processes
- Example: "Every morning before I wake up, create a daily brief"
- Example: "Anytime you see an email from a prospect, research that person and add to my CRM"

### User Experience Insight
> **Josh:** "If your users think of them as the same thing, it's just one of them's simple and the other's a bit more complex. It sometimes makes more sense to just call them the same thing."

> **Nik:** "It could be even just as simple as, like, hey, remember this, and then voice assistant behind the scene creates the rules. But my entry point is always that one person, and I never have to think about anything else."

## Future Vision: Marketplace for Agents

Nik shared a bigger vision inspired by the Claude Code community:

> "Conversations become instantaneous workflows that continue to run in the background. And even more, people can create their own best practices and share amongst other users."

**Concept:**
- Users build agents that work for them
- Share successful agents with others
- Import and customize others' agents
- Community-driven best practices

**Analogy:**
> "If you try to create a diet plan for yourself, it generally doesn't go well, but if you have a coach that's giving you a diet plan and that's all you get to eat, it's easier to say, okay, well, I just have to agree to it, and I don't have to think about it."

**Example Use Case:**
- Filter cold inbound emails, but surface relevant ones (e.g., "this is how you can build an agent")
- Auto-research the company
- Ask follow-up questions automatically
- Present prepared brief with required information

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### B2C2B Approach
> **Josh:** "Is it B2C2B, in the sense that you get somebody working for a company who's using it for their company. They talk to other folks, you've got multiple people in that company now using it. IT gets word of it, and they're like, well, if y'all are using it, we might as well consolidate it under single account."

> **Nik:** "The idea is that it's gonna come because users love it. Not because we are pushing for it just because we have salespeople. Product should speak for itself, and when it does, the sales portion is much easier."

### Value Measurement Challenge
Enterprise clients asking how to measure value:
- Time saved on meeting scheduling, prepping, emails sent
- Need to show "bigger value" - focus and better outcomes
- "You were able to get better outcomes because priority lens existed"

---

## Tools Mentioned
- **Google AI Studio** - For prototyping (converts Figma-like screens to working prototypes)
- **11Labs** - React components for voice/waveform
- **Lottie/Skia** - Animation frameworks for React Native
- **Claude Code** - Inspiration for community agent sharing

---

## Personal Note
Josh recommended **Tumble Leaf** (Amazon show) for Nik's son - they started watching it together. Both appreciated the slow pace and educational value teaching kids about objects.

---

## Action Items
1. **Nik:** Build something hands-on over the weekend/holiday period
2. **Josh:** Explore Google AI Studio
3. **Both:** Next week focus on defining dashboards and MVP systems
4. **Both:** Work on branding, style guides, elevator pitch

---

## Key Takeaway
> **Nik:** "Ball's in my court to be able to actually build something and experience it."

Goal: Have something built by Christmas week so Nik can go into "code mode" during the quiet holiday period.
