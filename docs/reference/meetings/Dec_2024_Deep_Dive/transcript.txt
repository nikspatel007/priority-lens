WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Josh Smith: There you go.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Nik Patel: Fantastic.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Nik Patel: Um, why is…

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Nik Patel: Alright, I think it…

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Nik Patel: Should be okay. It feels like, uh, the media, uh…

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Josh Smith: Continue to reset.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Nik Patel: Video is mirrored, and for the life of me, I can't see where to fix that, but it's fine.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I think it should be taking notes on its own now.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Nik Patel: this, and I am all with you, ready to go.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Josh Smith: Alright, what tool do you use for transcription?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Nik Patel: Uh, Zoom, uh, for the paid Zoom, it actually has it built in.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Nik Patel: So if I host the meeting, it will just, like, start the transcription, meeting notes, everything built in.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, I see.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, apologies, I never turn that on.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Nik Patel: It's all good.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Josh Smith: I got… and it's… it's not Zoom, I got spooked with, um…

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Josh Smith: Bo and I got… I think I spooked him. We, uh…

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Josh Smith: he would use… what was that other tool? Otter.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Nik Patel: Order? Yes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Josh Smith: And he would have… he and I would have conversations, and then the person would come in, they'd leave, and then we'd have conversations afterward.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Josh Smith: Whole thing recorded, and then it would just, like, send the whole thing to…

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Nik Patel: Ooh, yeah, that's not fun.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, it was just like… and it was, like, automatically on, they never asked if it's… they never asked if we wanted to send it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Josh Smith: So, I'm like, Bo, I don't think we…

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Josh Smith: I don't think we should use that one.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'm assuming, um…

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Josh Smith: Does Zoom automatically send summaries of the entire recorded span?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Nik Patel: Uh, it does, but right now it's said to only send to me.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Nik Patel: So, like, I can do whatever I want to with it. I have it set up that way.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Josh Smith: Oh, good.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Josh Smith: Good. Very important.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Nik Patel: Yep. I know. Yeah, especially if, like… yeah, you're right, because, like, generally it's easier to just stay on the call, and I have gotten in this habit of, like.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Nik Patel: Uh, if I want to chat about something, I always drop the call and start a new one. Uh, it's just…

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Nik Patel: because of this, Ed. Luckily, I haven't been burned, but uh…

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Nik Patel: I can see why we don't want to do that.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Josh Smith: That's a good habit to form.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Nik Patel: Yes, it's been worth it so far.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, so how's your week been?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Nik Patel: Uh, pretty good, actually. Um…

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Nik Patel: So, it's been just, like, a lot of work, busy, uh, work on the contracting stuff that I do.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Josh Smith: Good.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Nik Patel: But Thanksgiving weekend was actually fun in particular.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Nik Patel: Um, we…

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Nik Patel: We had, like, a friend staying over, and…

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Nik Patel: he's been, like, trying to learn coding, so I was like, alright, let me teach you.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Nik Patel: How fast can you go with coding, with wipe coding type of things?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Nik Patel: And not VIP coding in general, but, like, coding assistant is what I was teaching him.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Nik Patel: So, we ended up… all of us, me, Yankee.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nik Patel: we built, uh, an app, and then he ended up building his own app, and we… I got it in test flight, and…

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Nik Patel: So far, it's been pretty fun.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Nik Patel: Um, it's, uh, it's basically shared reminders, in a way.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Nik Patel: Uh, so she could just, like, say, hey, remind Nick to do something, and it would create a reminder for me, and remind me, and then vice versa.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, cool.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Nik Patel: And… it's, uh, in a way, it's sort of like…

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Nik Patel: light priority lens, right? Just because, um…

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Nik Patel: The hardest thing about any of this is not actually doing the task, or putting the task in the system.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Nik Patel: if I can put a task, then obviously it will remind me and everything. That's not the hard part, it's…

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Nik Patel: actually remembering that I have to put a task in a system. That's the thing that I want to solve for.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Nik Patel: Um, so we went back and forth across, like.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Nik Patel: Many different design iterations.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Nik Patel: And what I ended up doing is, uh, created, like, this, um.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Nik Patel: Uh, thing where, like, you can double tap on the phone.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Nik Patel: And it essentially creates the full… like, it opens up the…

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Nik Patel: voice transcription. You say the task, and it will, like, use the LLM.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Nik Patel: uh, so I could simply say.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Nik Patel: remind Anki to, you know.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, do something tomorrow at 9, and then it would basically do everything, uh, pick and key, figure out the timing.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Nik Patel: Write down the task, and then set it up for all of us.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Josh Smith: Oh, that's cool.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, so, um, now I'm getting into this habit of, like, oh, Anki's saying something, tap, tap.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Josh Smith: So you're actually… you're not… you're now starting to use it, and start to… starting to become part of your…

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Nik Patel: Yes, it's becoming my habit. And, um, what I'm building on top of it now, and we'll see when I have a chance, but…

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Josh Smith: your habits.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Nik Patel: now I want to, like, connect it… it's already, like, connected to Gmail, and there is, like, a family concept and stuff like that built in, so you could join a family or join a group.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Nik Patel: It started as a name family reminder, I ended up calling it Heads Up.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Nik Patel: But, um…

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Nik Patel: So the thought now is, like, because I'm connected to Gmail and that's how I'm logged in.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna start looking at my calendar and my emails.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Nik Patel: And that way, when something comes up in that, it will automatically create tasks from that as well.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, and based on that task, it will do all the backend research that needs to happen, if it needs to happen.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Nik Patel: So, something like…

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Nik Patel: We have a birthday coming up for our neighbor's daughter.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Nik Patel: And, um, if it knows, it would essentially go and do some research on what should we be gifting.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Nik Patel: and then give me a suggestion when I get to that task, and it's like, hey, here are the four options that he could pick from, just go use it and get it done.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Josh Smith: Oh, cool.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Nik Patel: So, you know, it's like a light version of Priority Lens, in a way.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Josh Smith: Oh, so you started… you started building this over the holiday break?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Nik Patel: Yes, it just turned out that way, it's like, let's build something.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Nik Patel: Um, and ended up building this, uh, it's actually in a test flight called Heads Up now, that's what I'm calling it for now.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Nik Patel: Um, so yeah, anyone can use it if they wanted to at this point, because it's, like, all connected and all working and all of that.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Josh Smith: Now, do you see this as, like, a separate…

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Josh Smith: product, or an extension of Priority Lens?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Nik Patel: I think it's, um, I will morph this into priority lens of what you are building. This was me, like, thinking through some things on, like, how do I make sure that I actually feel like using it?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Nik Patel: Um, right? So, like, I'm basically dogfooting it in a way.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Nik Patel: And I do have 2D steps, like, Google has tasks, and so does Microsoft. Everything…

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Nik Patel: That is out there for productivity system has the tasks just built into them.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Nik Patel: And then there is Jirai and Asana.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Nik Patel: 500 other platforms out there.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Nik Patel: In pretty much 95% cases, uh.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Nik Patel: anytime I have used this software, including Jira.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Nik Patel: Uh, for development teams. The issue has never been that.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Nik Patel: we can't get the task done, or we don't know what to do. It's how do I get that in there so I know what my…

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Nik Patel: Collective priorities look like, right?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Nik Patel: And if I had to think about it and actually type it out, for the most part, it's not happening.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Nik Patel: But if I could make that go easier and easier.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Nik Patel: that's when it would be, I think, worth it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Nik Patel: Um, so I also did it with this action button on iPhones, where you could just, like, click an action button and it could start that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Nik Patel: But not everything has action button, like, especially 15 has it, but before iPhones don't.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Nik Patel: So this tap-tap, I think, just is a very simple way to just make it work.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Nik Patel: And then I created 3 different things that's actually working out pretty good.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Nik Patel: One is, um…

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Nik Patel: shortcuts, so you could just say, hey CD, ask heads up to do something.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Nik Patel: And it would now basically open up the heads-up voice mode, and it just does it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Nik Patel: The other thing that I'm liking it so far is.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Nik Patel: you can copy something from somewhere, and as soon as you come to Heads Up, uh.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Nik Patel: it will…

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Nik Patel: deconstruct the… everything that is copied, and it would convert that into a task for you. So you don't even have to type it, you just copy and come back and be done with it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Nik Patel: Or you could just, like, share from some other app, so you could press your share button wherever there is a share button, and you could select heads up, and it will, like, create task.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Nik Patel: I still don't like that, because that's too many steps.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Nik Patel: So I'm… I'm working through this thing, and then the other thing that, um, I did was…

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Nik Patel: You could, like, just like you would bookmark when you're thinking about something and you want to read through that later, there are, like, apps for that, too.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Nik Patel: But what I… what I'm trying to create.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Nik Patel: with this whole priority lens thing is.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Nik Patel: everything has a context around what I'm doing, so you could share, like.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Nik Patel: URLs and stuff like that.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Nik Patel: And it will start to, like, auto…

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Nik Patel: auto-review and auto-create tasks and say, like, hey, these are the things you were thinking about today, here's it, and then it starts to go into notes section and start to create its own, like.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Nik Patel: Notion-type library, um…

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, all to say, I've just been experimenting a lot, so it's been fun.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Josh Smith: That sounds fun. Uh, and it's nice to… it's nice to use, uh, these days where you can…

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Josh Smith: Build rapidly to do exactly what you're mentioning, which is…

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Josh Smith: Um… get a sense…

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Josh Smith: of…

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Josh Smith: Is this…

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Josh Smith: Is this habit forming?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Josh Smith: It… yeah, just because it's a really cool idea doesn't mean…

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Josh Smith: It will slide in…

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Josh Smith: Easily to people's everyday use.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Nik Patel: Yes, exactly.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Josh Smith: And it's a simple mental model that they can swap with.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, getting that right is really important.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Nik Patel: Yep, that's the hard part. I think coding's getting easier now, so…

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Josh Smith: Hmm. Oh yeah, the human behavior part is always gonna be really difficult.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yep.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Josh Smith: Um, but I think… I think the coding part's difficult. I don't know how the heck did I… back in…

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, back in… well, I think…

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Nik Patel: In the beginning, it's easy, but once the systems start to get complex, we still need engineers, in a way.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Nik Patel: Engineers are not going away anytime soon.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Josh Smith: Oh, Jira.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Nik Patel: I wish Jira goes away, but…

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Josh Smith: What'd you say?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Nik Patel: We'll see.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Josh Smith: I'm not a fan either.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Josh Smith: It seems like every company I work with wants to use it. It's like, oh god.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Josh Smith: All right. All right, you want to jump into, uh, some of the design work?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Nik Patel: Yep, let's do it.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Josh Smith: Great. Uh, regarding mobile, uh, forgive me, um…

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Josh Smith: This is me being absent-minded. Did we discuss mobile when we were first talking about the work we were doing?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I think when we were chatting about it, it was the thought of, like.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Nik Patel: Um, because a lot of these people are busy, and they will be on the move between meetings and stuff like that, we want them to be able to do things on the mobile.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Nik Patel: In a way, the experience probably wouldn't change, it's the UI that's more tighter, just because we have less screen asset.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Alright.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, are they… and are they opening up an app, or are they just going to the browser?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Nik Patel: I think app. Uh, we don't…

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Nik Patel: We could do it in browser, we could make it…

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Nik Patel: uh, responsive and everything, I'm of a mindset is just send them to app, because then we get this other stuff that would be easier, like voice mode and some other things, that trying to do that from browser is, from a technical perspective, not optimal.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Alright.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Josh Smith: Great, yeah, apologies, I didn't…

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Josh Smith: I didn't factor that into the work, so…

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Nik Patel: Oh, boy. Um, do you know what that would look like? I definitely want to get, um.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Josh Smith: It's… it wasn't presented.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Nik Patel: Mobile, it's gotta be first-class citizen.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Nik Patel: Um, for, for what we are building.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Josh Smith: Let's…

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Josh Smith: Let me take some time…

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Josh Smith: Let's talk about targets before we move forward with this. What we'll do today is we'll run through.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Josh Smith: The… front-end concepts here.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Josh Smith: And talk through some of the details.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Nik Patel: Oh, speaking of which, do you mind if I record this call?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, of course, I thought you already were, sorry.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Nik Patel: Nope, nope, not by issue, man.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Alright, go ahead.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Josh Smith: Um, we'll go through these concepts and make sure that it represents kind of like the V1 for you, what's missing, what needs to be in there.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Josh Smith: Um, I added some concepts in there in case… just for thoughts.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Josh Smith: Um, for the chrome itself.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, when I do… I can convert these to mobile.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Josh Smith: Um… I may…

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Josh Smith: would it be okay if, for now, I converted them based on…

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Josh Smith: Just common patterns in how… how to access…

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Josh Smith: Uh, how to…

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, uh, reorder content, existing content, for a mobile device.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Josh Smith: Um… um…

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Josh Smith: You mentioned mobile first. There… that… that could be a very deep well.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Josh Smith: Of, um, what's the existing mobile technology that you can leverage that you can't.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Josh Smith: On, you know, on the, on the browser.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Josh Smith: Um, and…

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Josh Smith: What interactions do you want to introduce that are not present within the desktop version that you want to introduce in mobile?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, so for instance, like, um…

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Josh Smith: Like, reorienting the entire navigation to be, you know, bottom.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Josh Smith: Uh, bottom… bottom barred…

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Josh Smith: And, you know, slide in from the left.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Josh Smith: Um, we could… the chrome is probably gonna be the biggest…

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Josh Smith: Um… the most…

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Josh Smith: Uh… effort just to get that right.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Josh Smith: Once that's done, it's probably like, okay, well, for mobile.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Josh Smith: Can we just, um…

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Josh Smith: stack, you know, uh, stack…

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Josh Smith: The, um, page-level experience.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Josh Smith: So, it's not… it's not redesigning the entire page-level experience yet, it's just saying, okay.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Josh Smith: Let's design the page-level experience on the web so that when it's on a mobile device.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Josh Smith: Anything that's, like, HStack will be stack.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Josh Smith: Does that make sense?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Nik Patel: It does, yeah. Um, yeah, I think the things that I've been sort of, like, thinking through, um, and let me, let me, let me actually open up something.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Nik Patel: So, up here, I don't know if you can see that…

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Nik Patel: you see, like, how I have, like, 2 plus and then 2 bot stuff at the bottom?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Nik Patel: And how it will show.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I see that.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, so, um, the thought process for me has been…

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Nik Patel: Do you… do we go with the bottom navigation? Do we go with the breadcrumb on the side, just like…

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Nik Patel: The navigation that you have on the web.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Nik Patel: Do we, like, go with more infinite scroll approach, which doesn't make sense, since this is not social media?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Nik Patel: Um, where do we put things? How do… what do we put on infra…

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Nik Patel: on the front, what do we put, like, in the back, stuff like that. I think those are more the type of questions that I'm trying to answer.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Nik Patel: And I don't know if you have a preference, and what your thoughts are on, do we do bottom navigation? And if so, like, what actually goes on that?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Nik Patel: And if we were to, like, take this Chrome navigation that you have, uh, all the things that are on the left just straight up goes in the bottom navigation, that's easy.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Josh Smith: It's probably… that's probably what I would recommend out of the gate.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Nik Patel: Right?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, design a slick bottom navigation…

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Josh Smith: that…

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Josh Smith: Uh, just reflects the… as long as the side navigation, of course, is not too voluminous.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Josh Smith: Uh, for V1. Um, represent that in no more than at least, like, 5 with an option to open up.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Josh Smith: Of course, your, um…

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Josh Smith: Your pers… your… all of your utility, uh, navigation settings.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, we could do that. And that, uh, anything that…

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Josh Smith: Anything that has secondary navigation, or more complex.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Josh Smith: Options…

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Josh Smith: Pull out, like, a sidebar.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so do both is what you're saying.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh, it doesn't seem like you have a complex…

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Josh Smith: Yes, pull out the sidebar for when you get your utility.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Josh Smith: information. Um, when you get to your utility information, your navigation, so, like, yeah, your profile, your settings, your help, your… all that stuff.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Josh Smith: And, um, down the road, if…

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Josh Smith: Down the road, if any of your experiences involve.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Josh Smith: Secondary or tertiary level navigation, we'd have to figure that out.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Josh Smith: Where I would say, hmm, maybe we'd have to…

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Josh Smith: Sidebar that.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Nik Patel: Okay, yeah.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Josh Smith: But you don't have that right now, it seems. It seems like right now, you click…

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Josh Smith: You click on the navigation items on the left, they're single, they're…

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Josh Smith: For primary, they'll take you to a new page, rather than…

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Josh Smith: Asking you to select further options.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Nik Patel: Agree. Um, and yeah, I think from a…

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Nik Patel: on Figma or anything, like, even if it's just a sketch on a paper that you're putting together, I'm fine with it, because.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Nik Patel: I can still take that and build something out of it.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Nik Patel: I'll actually show you… I have it handy.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Nik Patel: I can show you something I had done, uh, for a recent…

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Nik Patel: requirement gathering session that I was doing for a client.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Nik Patel: it actually worked out pretty good. It's basically using SC diagrams.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Nik Patel: Now I need to log into my…

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Nik Patel: GitHub, and that's giving me a hard time.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, I can show it to you in a second, uh, don't want to waste time on that, but…

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Nik Patel: Let me… oh, actually, never mind, I am logged in here.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Nik Patel: Uh, give me one sec.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Nik Patel: The reason I'm saying that is, like, I understand, uh, since it was not top of your mind, it might be additional work.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Nik Patel: So, we do not need, like, high fidelity.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Nik Patel: stuff, I just need to know, like.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Nik Patel: how to put those components so that the UX is better. As far as the UI, I could… I could design that and get that going.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Nik Patel: No, no, that's not a big deal.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Nik Patel: So, um, if I were to share my screen…

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Nik Patel: So in here, um…

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Nik Patel: So I was doing the design session, or more so, like, requirements gathering type of a thing.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Nik Patel: And this is all I did. And this is SC diagrams, you could…

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Nik Patel: I asked Claude to help me generate them.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Nik Patel: But, like, this is all I needed to be able to show, to say, like, hey, this is what your UI could look like.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Nik Patel: And for the most part, they understood, like, what I meant and whatnot.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Nik Patel: From here on, I essentially used React, invite, and all the coding stuff.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Nik Patel: Uh, to convert this into an actual screen, and it turned out pretty…

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Nik Patel: Pretty good. So, I'm not saying, like, do this, I'm, like, if…

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Nik Patel: Sketching on a whiteboard or paper is easy for you, that's fine too.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Nik Patel: Instead of needing to do all of that in Figma. I'll leave it up to you, but just saying, like, even if you gave me this, that's okay.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay, I'll lower the fidelity.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, then I think at least you can put more time onto that.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Nik Patel: UX thinking, right? And…

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Nik Patel: Uh, makes it easy. Um…

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Nik Patel: However it works for you, um…

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Nik Patel: We go from there?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Josh Smith: Sure. Sure. Yeah, I will lower the fidelity. Um, some of the more UX, uh, or left… left focus work here was just on…

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Josh Smith: Positioning of… positioning of, consolidating of specific kinds of…

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Josh Smith: Um, items. Um, so if you wanted to review that, we could.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I did look at all of those screens already, like.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Nik Patel: this morning. Um…

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Nik Patel: Couple questions that I have. So, the way we are approaching it.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Nik Patel: is we have home, we need to figure out what goes on home, it seems like you're working through that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Nik Patel: Calendar, chats, people, and automations.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Nik Patel: The delegation piece, uh…

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Nik Patel: Where would that go? And priorities, where would that go?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Josh Smith: Um, let's… yeah, is that a, um… so this was just…

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, would that be another page?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Nik Patel: Um… I don't know, you tell me what would make it better.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Josh Smith: What is it… what is the… when someone delegates, what…

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Josh Smith: What… what's happening there?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Nik Patel: So… the whole delegation piece is, in a way, like a collaboration piece, right?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Nik Patel: the task is not something I'm going to do, but I want someone else to do it, or someone else has a task that they want me to do.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Nik Patel: And it needs to get into my queue.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, and there could be a couple things that could be going on. So, for example.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Nik Patel: let's say I ask my team to get something done, but I…

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Nik Patel: I do not want to be responsible for, like.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Nik Patel: it's not gonna be on top of my mind, because I have asked the team to do it.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Nik Patel: But I want to know where it is, and where it's going, and if there is a follow-up that needs to happen, and stuff like that.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Nik Patel: That's where all the delegation stuff comes into picture.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Nik Patel: It's essentially a way for us to know.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Nik Patel: what is something that I'm doing for myself, and, like, I have complete…

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Nik Patel: End-to-end control, versus what are the things that need someone else's attention and, uh.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Nik Patel: when I have asked them to do it.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Nik Patel: How is it going? If someone else has asked me to do it.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Nik Patel: How do I let them know that the work's done, stuff like that. So it's more like a collaboration piece than anything.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Nik Patel: And then the priorities is just straight up.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Nik Patel: based on everything that's going on, here's what you need to pay attention to. In my mind, that's probably just home.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Josh Smith: How many… how… what… what would… what do you think the size of the delegation…

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Josh Smith: how…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Josh Smith: Let me… so with delegation, is that…

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Josh Smith: Um, include your tasks and other people's tasks, or just…

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Josh Smith: other people's tasks.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Nik Patel: Don't know. Um, the way… now that I think about it, maybe we could use home for both of that.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Nik Patel: It's essentially delegation priorities, everything stays up.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Nik Patel: there, right? Um…

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Nik Patel: Because, ultimately.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Nik Patel: The crux of it is what needs to get done.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Nik Patel: And is it moving forward?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, like, their projects or topics…

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Nik Patel: Type of a concept.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Nik Patel: Because it's not just a one task, it might be part of a bigger thing that needs to happen, and we need to understand that.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Nik Patel: So that's… I think that's what we need to figure out, is could that be a separate…

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Nik Patel: Uh, menu, yeah, I like menu item on the left.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I think that could be.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Josh Smith: Are you, uh… are you in there right now, aren't you?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Nik Patel: I am Yaya.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Josh Smith: Okay, let's do some hierarchy here.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Josh Smith: So, imagine I have a project.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Josh Smith: That projects have…

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Josh Smith: tasks I need to do.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Josh Smith: Some of which may be my priorities.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then, uh…

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Josh Smith: Tasks for others.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna copy a couple of these.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so you're gonna have multiple projects, they're gonna have certain tasks you need to do, certain tasks for others, it's, uh, those projects will have con…

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Josh Smith: context. They'll also have, like, people.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Josh Smith: Uh, people involved…

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Josh Smith: Bought that there. Alright.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Josh Smith: Home, essentially, would have kind of a priority of tasks across projects.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Josh Smith: Priority of delegate…

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Josh Smith: delegated…

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Josh Smith: tasks across projects.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Nik Patel: I…

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Nik Patel: I think when I think about it, I think about it like this.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Nik Patel: Um, what needs my attention?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Nik Patel: and I need to act on.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Nik Patel: And what is FYI for me?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, like, the delegated task across projects and stuff like that is more FYI. I just want to know that it's moving forward, and if it's not, something needs to happen, then I can just…

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Nik Patel: Quickly glance over and say, hey guys.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Nik Patel: XYZ stuff, right?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Nik Patel: Um… what needs my attention then can be broken down into, is this a task, is this a meeting?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Nik Patel: Is this a research? Is this heads down?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Nik Patel: Bundle of stuff, whatever that might be.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Nik Patel: And, um…

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Nik Patel: The time component is… is the important part here.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Nik Patel: is when do I actually sit down to do this, like, bunch of tasks?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Nik Patel: When do I say, no, I need to actually prepare for the meeting?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Nik Patel: when do I say, like, okay, I'm gonna be in a meeting, so I can't do any of this?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Nik Patel: When do I know that something needs to be rescheduled, and it just gets rescheduled?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Nik Patel: So the other piece, um, the portion of FYI could be, hey, here are all the things that's, like, starting to pile up, and here are the things you could do about it. Approve, approve, reject, reject, like.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Nik Patel: quick decisions where AI can start to take actions.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, like, go reschedule a meeting. Okay, I've done it, I'm gonna find a time for you, and then this is the time that works.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Nik Patel: It's open, do you want me to do it? Sure.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Nik Patel: done with it.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Josh Smith: Cool. And in that instance, is that where AI would…

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Josh Smith: recommend.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Nik Patel: And what I'm trying to figure out is.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Nik Patel: Is the recommendation built into a task?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Nik Patel: Right? Or is that a separate thing that I need to say, like, oh, let me look at AI recommendations?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Nik Patel: Um, because if I'm thinking from a mindset perspective.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Nik Patel: it could be, I need to know what's going on, or I know exactly what needs to happen, and I'm gonna get into it. Those are different type of recommendations.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Nik Patel: Um, like, a broader thing?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Nik Patel: that needs my attention, like, I have 10 things on my plate today, and there is no way I'm gonna get it done. I gotta figure this out.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Nik Patel: what can I delegate? What can AI take care, what can I do with myself, right? We are in this, like.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Nik Patel: get-it-done mode. Um…

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Nik Patel: then I know the task. So, like, for example, this morning.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Nik Patel: I was sitting down to, like, look at.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Nik Patel: what you had, it's like, I have a meeting coming up, I want to go in prepared.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Nik Patel: make sure that I have, like, 10 minutes, 15 minutes of time, and I can prepare myself. Like, I can read through docs, I can look through this.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Nik Patel: I quickly looked at it, and I know what it is, and I can be much better prepared coming into this meeting, versus.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Nik Patel: Hey, Josh, sorry you didn't have time, and then now you… you catch me up on it. That just…

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Nik Patel: Doesn't feel right as a leader.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Nik Patel: Then, um, last but not the least, right.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Nik Patel: There could be stuff that is more, like, long-term, strategic.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Nik Patel: Um, where nothing's due right this moment, but if I didn't start moving it right now.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Nik Patel: something that needs to happen in Q1 will not happen.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Nik Patel: So, think of, like, um…

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Nik Patel: the priority stuff. Yeah, more strategy stuff, right? Like, outcomes that we are expecting, and…

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Josh Smith: Should you call those strategies?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Nik Patel: for us to get there, we need to do XYZ things, and…

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Nik Patel: it's piling up, we will not be able to get there. So…

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Nik Patel: Um… let's say we are looking at a Q1 launch.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Nik Patel: We need to figure out brand, website, product, UI, UX.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Nik Patel: uh, launch, company.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Nik Patel: payments, all of that stuff, right? And how are we gonna go to market? All of this needs to happen.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Nik Patel: But all of them needs to go in parallel. Some I may be doing, some I may not be doing. How do I know, like.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Nik Patel: how these things are going. Um…

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Nik Patel: In many cases, it could be a second-order effect.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Nik Patel: So, like, it could show, like, hey, you gotta focus on this, otherwise you are gonna fall back on, or fall behind on your project.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Nik Patel: which could be Q1 launch. We can take them to that and, like, show a bigger…

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Nik Patel: broader thing, um…

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Nik Patel: Let me rephrase. Show a…

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Nik Patel: More contextual information, because we have brought their mind into one thing versus everything that's going on in their life.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Nik Patel: So I think those are the type of things that I don't know how to properly structure, and…

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Nik Patel: Not make them think, and…

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Nik Patel: Make it easy, where it's like, oh, this is understanding me, and we are going about it the right way.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, from a technical perspective, it's not something that…

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Nik Patel: Bo and I have chatted about yet, but I've been starting to think about.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Nik Patel: what can I do to build some of the UI components on the fly?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Nik Patel: That actually makes sense for…

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Nik Patel: For people to, like…

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Nik Patel: Have the collection of information in a way it makes sense.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, like, there is the determination of, like, okay, when you go here, it's always gonna look the same.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Nik Patel: Um, but there are types of things where it's like.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Nik Patel: if I ask you what… and I think Versal did a good job at this, and showcasing, and…

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Nik Patel: I have not seen anyone implement that good.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Nik Patel: Except ChatGPT trying. If I ask for weather to a chat GPT, it could give me, just straight up, the weather right now is blah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Nik Patel: Or it could create a widget and just show me what the weather could look like.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Nik Patel: Right? And that point, that UI component is auto-generated.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Nik Patel: But it's a much better experience, because it's right in the moment and stuff like that. Again, I don't know what it means, but been thinking about it, and…

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Nik Patel: I don't know if we need to worry about it in V1.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Well, that helps me know how you think.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Josh Smith: Five years ago, I was talking with.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Josh Smith: even before AI, I was having conversations with designers and just saying, hey.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Josh Smith: We need to start thinking now about how, down the road.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Josh Smith: We're not just gonna be designing pages.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Josh Smith: Pages are going to shift and change.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Josh Smith: Components are going to be designing on the fly.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Josh Smith: Um, based on…

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Josh Smith: At a very personal level, per user.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Nik Patel: Right.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Josh Smith: Based on what we know about them. And…

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Josh Smith: How, how, yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Josh Smith: designers never did, we never really prepared for it, but it was just one of those, like, hey, we're gonna get to a place where it's… Figma is gonna…

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Josh Smith: Vigma's already tanking. Um…

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Nik Patel: Yes, big time.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Josh Smith: Uh, because they're realizing that the way we design needs to change.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Josh Smith: Um, cause we can't think about it as in page to page to page to page, it's like, uh…

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. How do you get all this stuff in? Okay.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Josh Smith: Alright, this is helpful, um…

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Josh Smith: about, uh, let's, um, so if I can reorient and align to how I can help you.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Josh Smith: Um, this is much less about what I had done, which was, like.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Josh Smith: Mid-fi, page to page, but more about…

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Josh Smith: Um, having conversations like this and brainstorming.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Josh Smith: Uh, coming to some conclusions about…

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Josh Smith: What things should look like and how they should interact.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Josh Smith: How it makes sense to the user.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Josh Smith: In that… to that…

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Josh Smith: regard. Would it…

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Josh Smith: be… I think it would, but would it be more valuable if…

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Josh Smith: You and I spent more time chatting.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Josh Smith: Rather than last time chatting.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Nik Patel: Yes. I think so. I'm leaning towards that, too, because…

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Nik Patel: from a UI perspective, uh, I could take a stab at it and say, like, hey, Josh, is this, like, good design in general? But if we have the structures figured out.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Nik Patel: we know that UX.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Nik Patel: Ultimately, the goal is not that UI is…

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Nik Patel: the only way for people to interact, it's…

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Nik Patel: We wanted more proactive than reactive.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Nik Patel: if I… if user needs to rely on UI, that's reactive.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Nik Patel: They have to come to my system.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Nik Patel: we want it other way around. So, like, there is gonna be a lot of structure, and…

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Nik Patel: How do I do things when…

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Nik Patel: User needs to know about it, and user's not even thinking about it, and…

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Nik Patel: then bring them to UI and show them what they need to know to actually get their work done is essentially the mindset.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Nik Patel: So yeah, I think it's probably more useful for us to chat, and…

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Nik Patel: Put the structures together, um…

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Nik Patel: And then we can clot code it, uh, just to see if some of this lo-fi utility might work out.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Josh Smith: Great. Alright, I will reorient around that.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Josh Smith: You let me know how much time you'd like to spend.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, I could see it being, like, 2-3 times a week.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Josh Smith: Uh, this is how I worked with Bo, where I did a lot of lo-fi…

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Josh Smith: Wireframes together in conversation, coming to consensus about how things need to operate.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Josh Smith: Of course, back then, they didn't have an easy… AI wasn't where it is now, where you can take all that stuff and just…

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Josh Smith: build out from there. Um, yes, and providing feedback.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Josh Smith: Um, and I… I could provide a ton of feedback, actually, um…

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Josh Smith: Uh… alright, yeah.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Josh Smith: Let me know what cadence.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Josh Smith: During the day is best for you.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Nik Patel: I think mornings are pretty good, like, 9, 9.30ish generally works out really well.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Nik Patel: So 9 AM is when I end up dropping my son to daycare.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Nik Patel: 9.05, we are generally back home. 9.30, I'm ready to go.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Nik Patel: But we could… we could adjust around whatever timing. I think the earliest I can do, probably, would be 9.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Nik Patel: I need 8 to 9 free, so it's gotta be before 8, or…

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Nik Patel: After 9, before 11.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Nik Patel: Those are the times that are generally free.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Nik Patel: And then all the other stuff, it might have it to be more…

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Nik Patel: Well, I'll have to see what my calendar looks like, and we can jump on calls.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Josh Smith: Alright, what do you think about, uh, Tuesday, Thursday, 9.30 to 11.30?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Nik Patel: Could work out. I'm actually flying on Tuesday morning next week, though.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Josh Smith: Don't worry, you and I… you and I are both out next week.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Nik Patel: So next week's gonna be…

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Nik Patel: Oh, you're out next week, okay, um…

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Josh Smith: I'm back on Thursday next week, but I'm out Monday and Wednesday next week.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Nik Patel: Same. I'm back on Thursday as well, next week.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Nik Patel: Um… would it make sense to spend more time today?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Josh Smith: If you're comfortable. If you're comfortable with that, yeah.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Nik Patel: Do you wanna go… yeah, do you wanna go through, like.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Nik Patel: noon 30. I have a call at noon 30, and then I can jump back on call till 2 p.m.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Nik Patel: 1 to 2 Central.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let's go till noon 30.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Josh Smith: I will be…

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Josh Smith: I'll be out on… I'll be out until…

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Josh Smith: 4PM your time.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Nik Patel: I… sure, um, I could jump back on…

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Nik Patel: I'll let you know, like, let's text, but if I need to jump back on later.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Nik Patel: I, I'm open…

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Nik Patel: Evenings are actually generally pretty free. I don't want to…

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Nik Patel: enforce evening or anything, I work evenings, uh, just because it's easier for me.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Nik Patel: Weekends also work, weekend mornings are pretty good for me, but I don't want to enforce any of that, it's just know that.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Nik Patel: I'm available at all times, or weekends are actually much easier.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Nik Patel: Um, and then weekdays, mornings are much better. Everything else gotta be flexible, just because meetings show up from clients.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. Um…

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'm mostly flexible in the evenings, too.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Nik Patel: Oh, perfect, then I think that might be better if it works out both for us.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, even if you want to do, like, um…

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Josh Smith: If you want to do, like, a Monday-Wednesday after next week.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Josh Smith: And do, like, uh, closer to end of day.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Josh Smith: I can do that.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Nik Patel: Okay, sounds good. So…

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Nik Patel: Since you're gone…

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Nik Patel: Um, next week, my thinking has been, like, what can I do to start, like, building some of these components around?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Nik Patel: And it doesn't feel like right… I'm not terribly worried about building UI right now.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Nik Patel: I'm more thinking through, like, how do I start to put structure in my mind that makes sense as a user?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Nik Patel: So if we can start to think through it, it's like, okay, this structure's in place, now how do I build more structures on top of that structure? So…

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Josh Smith: Let's talk about that.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Nik Patel: That's what I really need help.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Josh Smith: I love those conversations. Uh, let's talk about that. So…

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Josh Smith: Um, you're in the page, you're following me a bit?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Nik Patel: I am, yes.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Josh Smith: Alright, cool.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Josh Smith: Uh, some stuff you might already know, like, um.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Josh Smith: And… I'm gonna…

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna play around with this a bit. Um…

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Josh Smith: that, um…

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Josh Smith: The way, like, the way folks think is, of course, they have, like, a, you know, strategy, long-term, uh, outcome.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Josh Smith: But usually with… with people, they don't…

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Josh Smith: Most people aren't outcome-focused.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Josh Smith: So, it's like… like…

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Josh Smith: probably not with this tool, you want to teach them how to become outcome-focused, because it's like, maybe you could use AI, just be like, oh, here, uh, but…

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Josh Smith: Um, so they usually think still in terms of outputs here, and of course that's long-term, so that's what, like, um…

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, two to four quarters of the year about, um, things that they need to accomplish.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Josh Smith: Regardless of what they call them. You know, all throughout the country. Strategies, strategic themes, portfolio.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Josh Smith: Epics, you know, like, whatever they are.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Josh Smith: Um, and some of those, um, when those break down into tasks, or get delegated to groups, sometimes it involves structural changes.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Josh Smith: Operations, processes, involves change management, but then ultimately comes down to those… all those… all those tasks that… that come together.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Josh Smith: And then there could be any number of projects, um…

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Josh Smith: Going from one to the other.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Josh Smith: Your, uh… your experience right now, um…

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Josh Smith: I'll move this over here. Your experience right now, I noticed the… let me actually go to the website and pull up…

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Josh Smith: And copy in your navigation.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Josh Smith: We can do that right now.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Josh Smith: So you have an outcomes section already.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Josh Smith: And you called it outcomes.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Josh Smith: You don't have a project section.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Josh Smith: Now, is that your… is that outcomes?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Nik Patel: There were supposed to be outcomes, yeah.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay. Alright, gotcha.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Josh Smith: So the way I have it here is that…

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Josh Smith: Uh, so here's another way of thinking about it, I'm not gonna say it's the right way, that there are…

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Josh Smith: That you can create, uh, one or more projects in order to serve a particular outcome.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Josh Smith: But that's kind of like a more of a breakdown.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Nik Patel: Sorry, um, I was talking mute, but yes, it makes sense.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay, all good. Um…

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Josh Smith: your, um…

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Josh Smith: So let's take a look at the current navigation.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Josh Smith: let's say… so you have a today's agenda. I… I just made that home, but, uh, when we talk…

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, home's better.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Josh Smith: When we… only because today's agenda may be more, um…

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Josh Smith: It's way more specific than home.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Josh Smith: So it's like, okay, that's what I want. Uh, at the same time, um…

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Josh Smith: the prevalent mental model is home, unfortunately. It's just like…

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, uh, in the same way, like, the prevalent color for a link is blue, uh, underlined.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Josh Smith: Why? Because some dude decades ago thought that.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Nik Patel: Decided, yeah.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Uh…

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Josh Smith: So… but anyway, um, and I can help you make decisions on copy there. With Home, we talked about, um.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Josh Smith: Yes, that should be surfacing… priorities of tasks across.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Josh Smith: Across all of your…

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Josh Smith: Call them outcomes if you want. Um…

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Nik Patel: What do you think would be better? Is outcome a better word, or project is a better word?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Josh Smith: Project, only because…

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Josh Smith: Outcomes is sophisticated.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, okay.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Josh Smith: And you are a sophisticated thinker.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Josh Smith: And I wish I lived in a world where everybody understood outcomes.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Nik Patel: That's fair, I see that. Um, so the names that we had was…

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Nik Patel: So let's… let's keep outcomes. Um, projects and topics were another ways to, like, think through this.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Josh Smith: Topics.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Nik Patel: And…

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Nik Patel: We could go either way. When I think of project, I think structure. When I think of topic, I think of collection of information.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Nik Patel: And I don't know which one would make sense. If it's projects, so be it.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Nik Patel: Don't have, uh, preference one way or the other.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Josh Smith: Well, you know, in fa… you could…

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Nik Patel: I'm curious.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Josh Smith: You could say strategy, too.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Josh Smith: Uh, although strategy is an amorphous term. Uh, everyone… not everyone defines it the same.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Josh Smith: Topics, um…

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Josh Smith: Topics may be something that is a horizontal thread across projects.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Josh Smith: Um, people might interpret that as a topic as a form of tagging.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, like, topic and theme.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Josh Smith: Are… are… are adjacent.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Josh Smith: Um, what are the themes? What are we surfacing across these various, uh, needs?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, if you were to create an outcome section.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Josh Smith: It could be, um…

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Josh Smith: You could potentially constrain it to being very outcome-oriented.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Josh Smith: It may appeal to a market that understands or is used to familiar with OKRs.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, um…

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I like the idea of, like, projects, and then topics are…

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Nik Patel: Just, like, cross-sectional, in a way.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Nik Patel: Across multiple things. Um, so yeah, let's stick to that for now, that should be okay.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Josh Smith: I'm just going to design…

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Josh Smith: Models.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Josh Smith: As we talk…

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Josh Smith: Now…

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Josh Smith: I do this just to make sure that…

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Josh Smith: We don't lose any of our thoughts.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Josh Smith: And for me, instead of…

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Josh Smith: writing out.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Josh Smith: concepts, I visualize them, so…

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Nik Patel: And, funny enough, this could be actually a documentation on how we think about it.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Josh Smith: Oh, mhm.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Nik Patel: So, when someone looks through UI, it's just, in a way, we are…

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Nik Patel: Making you better, blah.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Nik Patel: Um, so, I like that.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Josh Smith: Cool.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Josh Smith: Um… there's…

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Josh Smith: Kind of like a pivot table, um…

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Josh Smith: Each project… so there's the component of a project, but then there's, um…

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Josh Smith: There's a component of a project itself, but then there's across all of those individual objects.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Josh Smith: So, you can either… I'm assuming that… tell me if this is accurate or not, that in this experience.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Josh Smith: You would want someone to take a look at this project, as you have in the current experience, and be able to see everything involved in that project.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Josh Smith: But you also want to be able to view the individual pieces separately in aggregate as well.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Josh Smith: So, I want to see all the tasks across all projects, which is what the homepage… that homepage would be.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Josh Smith: All delegated tasks across the projects, um…

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Josh Smith: You know, you have a people section.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Josh Smith: And people is an aggregate.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Josh Smith: You know, um, but when you go to outcomes, you also want to see the people that are associated with it.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Nik Patel: With that one, yeah.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Josh Smith: Um, now people, in your mind, is not simply a ref… is not simply reference data, correct? It's…

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, when you go to…

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Josh Smith: When you see people.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Josh Smith: Um, AI may surface people you didn't put in there, AI may aggregate. Uh, I'm assuming it may recommend merging?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Josh Smith: If it can't, like, will there be some sort of, like, oh gosh, there's, like, 3 Josh Smiths? Which happens?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Josh Smith: We… do you want to combine them?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Josh Smith: So, there might be some… may or may not.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Josh Smith: be some effort, um, and I'm just making assumptions, on part of the user.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Josh Smith: uh, to receive recommendations from AI to take actions, and then…

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Josh Smith: And they'll just say, yes, yes, yes, no, yes, no.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Um, yeah, I built the merge UI for this app that I built over the weekend.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Nik Patel: The thought was…

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Nik Patel: If someone is in my contact, they may have a phone number, but someone joining the family might be joining through email.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Nik Patel: How can I, like, combine them into one thing?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Nik Patel: And then, I also started giving them, like, phrases, so when I say Anki.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Nik Patel: Anki is Ankita, that is also my spouse.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Nik Patel: Stuff like that. So, like, mom means this person, dad means that person type of a stuff.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Nik Patel: Uh, which makes it easy for me to just say, like, hey, call Dan.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Nik Patel: And if I'm in a work setting, right, Dan is probably this Dan, versus if I'm talking with my…

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Nik Patel: wife, in a different context, and then the den might be different then.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Nik Patel: So I started thinking about it, it's…

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Nik Patel: Probably, like, 10-15% done, just the merge portion is done, but yes, that is a thing that we'll have to think through.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Josh Smith: Okay. And I know I'm jumping around, um…

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Nik Patel: Oh, good. In fact, now that I think about it from, like, a data perspective.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Nik Patel: Uh, people, tasks, projects.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Nik Patel: Outcomes, like, a lot of those are… think of that like a data cube, and this is like a different way of slicing and dicing and showing that.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Nik Patel: Data in a different…

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Nik Patel: With a different, uh, entry point.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Okay.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Josh Smith: Primary, um…

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Josh Smith: Is the… now, thinking about the, uh, experience.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Josh Smith: It may be new for folks, but, um…

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Josh Smith: primary, um…

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Josh Smith: Recommend… the primary experience.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Josh Smith: um… is responding to recommendations from AI and.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Josh Smith: And yaying or neighing that, rather than…

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Josh Smith: The… the user having to initiate.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Josh Smith: Would that be accurate to say?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Nik Patel: That's… yes, that is the primary, uh, experience.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Nik Patel: One thing I would put is, um.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Nik Patel: there are two modes that I would act in as a user.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Nik Patel: I'm a decision maker, so we're gonna make decisions, and…

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Nik Patel: I expect AI to…

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Nik Patel: recommend, or I'm a…

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Nik Patel: collaborator, when I'm going through something and I want AI to be my companion. Go do this research.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Nik Patel: Um, is this the right thing to do? Find me this information. So that's more, like.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Nik Patel: my assistant that's helping me get through a task together, while I'm actually thinking about one line of thought, and…

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Nik Patel: some more information. So, which is what people use ChatGPT type of things today for.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Josh Smith: Cool.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Josh Smith: Um… now, I… yep.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Nik Patel: AI is not the decision maker, person is.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Nik Patel: Right? AI is the recommender, if that's even a word.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Josh Smith: I am a decision maker, AI is the…

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Josh Smith: Recommender.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Josh Smith: Well, okay, and if we, like, if we racy it, um…

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Josh Smith: Um, AI acts on it, though, as well, right?

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Nik Patel: It acts on it, yes. It does the pre-work.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Nik Patel: So, I can make a decision.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Nik Patel: The other portion is the decision's not known yet, so we need to work together to get a decision, and AI is basically my companion.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Nik Patel: I'm driving.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Josh Smith: Got you.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Josh Smith: Um, this is a minor detail, because I…

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Josh Smith: I go through forests through weeds often. Um, this is just a recommended interaction when you build, want to know your thoughts on this, that instead of… so…

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Josh Smith: Stuff on the right, um…

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Josh Smith: Um, so you've heard of the fovea, um, the humans have an area of focus that's actually the size of the quarter, everything else is peripheral.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, yeah. Uh, we, we, when we think of peripheral, we often think, oh, it's just over here. No, it's actually… it's actually everything down to the size of a quarter.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Nik Patel: Oh, okay.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Josh Smith: Um, for that… so, for that reason, um.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, anything you…

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Josh Smith: Anything you put outside of that.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Josh Smith: Um, is initially out of sight, out of mind.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Josh Smith: Um, so I always recommend, uh, whether or not this is the actual interaction pattern, the idea of, uh, keeping your chat.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Josh Smith: Uh, coming out of the left side.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Josh Smith: Um, rather than, uh, anything coming out on the right.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Nik Patel: Um, just to confirm, are you saying that.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Nik Patel: When AI is a collaborator, the chat should be on the left side instead of right.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Josh Smith: Now, that might break a common mental model that we might see in other apps. Oh, it comes out on the right.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Yeah.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Josh Smith: Um… that…

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Josh Smith: Coming on the right might impact usage, and it might impact perception of its importance as part of the rest of the application.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Josh Smith: to the user.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Yeah, because I'm thinking about, like.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Nik Patel: Slack, Microsoft.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Nik Patel: all of this daily use product has that… so, like, threads on Slack basically comes from Write, right?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Nik Patel: in Microsoft Copilot comes from, right?

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Nik Patel: Um, if you're doing co-pilot or design and stuff like that on PowerPoint and whatnot.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Nik Patel: It's mainly because the left side is already taken, so, like.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Nik Patel: For all of them, the left side is always…

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Nik Patel: people, conversations I'm having.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Nik Patel: things I'm focusing on, stuff like that.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Nik Patel: So if we overlay chat on top of that, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Nik Patel: Assuming B has something on the left side, too.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Josh Smith: Depends, you can push it.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Josh Smith: You could push it, um, or you could overlay it.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Josh Smith: That can be solved. Um, the…

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Josh Smith: The co-pilot coming from the right.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Josh Smith: Is… and this might be more, like, ontological, like, how do you see this companion as part of the application?

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, VS Code, uh, Copilot was introduced after VS Code was around.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Josh Smith: Um, so it wasn't… it wasn't factored into the overall experience. And what is… and what's our… what's our understanding of Copilot?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, in its relation to our day-to-day work within VS Code.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then, how is that similar or different to…

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, the centrality of…

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Josh Smith: uh, AI within your application?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Josh Smith: Um, is it…

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Josh Smith: Is it just an ex… like, a browser extension?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Josh Smith: Sitting over on the right and sliding in, or is it more central to the work that's being… that the person is being, uh, is doing?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Nik Patel: I think more the latter.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Nik Patel: But especially when I'm in a recommend… or, sorry, collaborator mode.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Nik Patel: what I would… in an ideal world, what I think would be great is if it was on equal footing.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Nik Patel: So, like, we had, like, two different things going on where I'm doing my work, and it's doing its own work, and, like, I'm seeing both.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Nik Patel: That, I think, puts it on equal footing. Left or right, I'm still leaning towards right, but left or right.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Nik Patel: Doesn't matter.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Nik Patel: At that point, I think left might make sense, because then I could open something on the right as an action that needs to be taken.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Nik Patel: That goes on a ride.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Nik Patel: Right, so that may work out, but I'm still of a mindset that.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Nik Patel: we are putting AI on an equal footing, and not just, uh, you are just another sidekick out there, because that's…

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Nik Patel: What the whole platform's about.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Josh Smith: Okay. If that's the case, I know it… I know it breaks an existing mental model and a lot of other solutions where AI came in after the fact.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Josh Smith: you see a lot of AI-central… AI-centric tools.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Josh Smith: Uh, right now, where AI is prominent, of course, it's on the left.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, think about it.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Yeah, we can play it out with both, and experience both and see.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Nik Patel: Like, moving from left to right is probably just changing a Dave's alignment.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Nik Patel: So, that portion might be okay, it's what happens inside is what…

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Nik Patel: Nothing is important.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Josh Smith: Yes, and we'll have to discuss that at some point, what is the…

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Josh Smith: What's the structure of conversation that actually occurs?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Josh Smith: Um, there's just another quick…

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Josh Smith: um, concept here. If there's any object…

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Josh Smith: If there's any object that, um…

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Josh Smith: I'm… it's not too entirely complex.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Josh Smith: as, um…

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Josh Smith: Uh, is… is a list… a list of objects.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Josh Smith: that you can do CRUD on.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Josh Smith: Or a list of…

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, a history of items.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Josh Smith: Um, it may benefit to think about how can you interact with those in the experience in a way where.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, you're not losing context to where you are.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Josh Smith: If… if… if reference data and list objects and audit and track change logs.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Josh Smith: If those things are much…

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Josh Smith: If the user is much more likely to want to interact with them in a way where, yeah, they're…

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Josh Smith: They still don't want to lose context to what they're… to the primary… the primary use.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, I…

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Josh Smith: Thinking about interactions that you can introduce.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Josh Smith: To keep… keep them from feeling like they're being taken away.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Josh Smith: So, um, that may not necessarily need to be a modal.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes. I…

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Nik Patel: I think there is also this thought of canvas.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Nik Patel: depending on the type of work we are doing, where, like, both AI and user can act in a similar thing.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Nik Patel: So, for example, let's say in a Figma style.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Nik Patel: Um, we are talking through it, and if I could essentially.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Nik Patel: Say, um, hey, we are talking about this.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Nik Patel: talking about AI as a decision maker, start to, like, build some stuff for me so I can, like, visualize that.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Nik Patel: And I'm gonna say yay or nay, and then just, like, discard it.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Nik Patel: that's still, like, high value, because I visualized it, and that value in itself would have taken a long time without AI.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Nik Patel: So, maybe there are, like.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Nik Patel: brainstorming mode when AI is, like, just within that canvas and doing things and whatnot might be a good…

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Nik Patel: good experience that I haven't seen, and I don't know why, but…

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Nik Patel: it seems like that's, like, a common thing for Figma to be able to do, and.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Nik Patel: It's not there. It's not the right of.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, well, and let's talk about that, too. Um, this is just for thought, um…

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Josh Smith: I've complained about this for years.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Josh Smith: Um… great, now I'm gonna complain about it.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Nik Patel: Go for it.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Josh Smith: In front of you. Uh, but brainstorming… I'll use your word, brainstorming.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'll also call it divergence.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Josh Smith: call it expansion.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Josh Smith: And this is just about, like, exploring possibilities.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Josh Smith: Um, with… with…

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, at least in, uh, designer creative trades for over a century now.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, there, uh, have been models.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Josh Smith: Where, um, creatives…

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Josh Smith: We'll split the type of work that they do.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Josh Smith: Where…

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Josh Smith: Portion of their work is…

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Josh Smith: about discovering.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Josh Smith: without judgment.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Josh Smith: playing around.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Josh Smith: gathering information.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Josh Smith: Looking at information in different ways.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Josh Smith: And then… then comes the, uh, the, the stage of planning.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Josh Smith: Which, um…

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Josh Smith: Takes a look at that against, um…

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Josh Smith: The factors, like.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Josh Smith: That lend to prioritization.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Josh Smith: Just gonna use a whole bunch of different words here.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Josh Smith: And then starts to narrow down on an approach.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then, of course, that overall act of planning.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Josh Smith: You know, this whole overall act of planning.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Josh Smith: Get you to, ultimately, the decision.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Josh Smith: Jira, most tools… I'm gonna put a big red box around this.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Josh Smith: Most tools don't design for this.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Josh Smith: At all.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Josh Smith: As you mentioned Figment.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Josh Smith: Figma is not built for this.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Josh Smith: Uh, FigJam… FigJam kind of is built for a lot of this type of effort.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Josh Smith: Uh, but, uh, one big hurdle…

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Josh Smith: With, um, building a tool.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Josh Smith: That allows you to do this is that people.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Josh Smith: Many people aren't used to doing this and know how to do this.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Nik Patel: And I think even taking this.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Nik Patel: Little bit.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Nik Patel: Um, further, that decision basically is a feedback loop into that same process again, right?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Nik Patel: Because it's generally a never-ending cycle. Like, okay, you made this decision, now what? And then you just go through that same process again, and then again, and again.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so the decision…

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Josh Smith: Of course.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Josh Smith: Creates its own outcome.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Josh Smith: Oh, or series of outcomes.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Josh Smith: That… yes, puts you back over again.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Josh Smith: Where you're like, okay, now what do we do?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Josh Smith: And then it's the whole, are we moving closer to the goal, or farther away from…

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Josh Smith: the thing. Um, what did we learn?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Josh Smith: Um, where, like, AI is the, you know, AI…

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Josh Smith: could AI… when you were thinking about what AI can do.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh, can it surface? What did we learn?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Josh Smith: Uh, can it, um…

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Josh Smith: Do a bulk of the gathering.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Josh Smith: Uh, of ideas.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Josh Smith: Um… that's what I use AI for. I'm like, I don't have…

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Josh Smith: I don't have time to scour the world and find.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Josh Smith: All these variants of concepts, uh, for reference, or, uh…

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Josh Smith: um… information.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Josh Smith: And I guess that's what you mean when, like, uh, you're…

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Josh Smith: Talking about, um… I need to get to an idea, right?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Josh Smith: Now, it would be helpful for AI to know.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Josh Smith: Some of this information, correct?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Josh Smith: It doesn't have that on its own.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Josh Smith: Any information about your company, your market, your…

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Josh Smith: Or, if it's not, if it's…

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Josh Smith: It's not specific to a business, like…

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Josh Smith: Is there a section of the experience where you can.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Josh Smith: provide this information, or it, like, um…

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, will it learn along the way?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Nik Patel: Yes, like, what I'm envisioning from an experience perspective.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Nik Patel: Actually…

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Nik Patel: Uh, that's… I'm not…

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Nik Patel: I should know, but, like, do you know if Zoom allows for multi-screen share?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Nik Patel: Dozen, right?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Josh Smith: It doesn't, but I'm not screen sharing.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, you're right, huh?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Josh Smith: Oh, that's fine.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Nik Patel: Let me actually do this.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Nik Patel: Trying to see if I can log into Zoom, but…

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Josh Smith: Starting to cease. Well, you're in there now, yeah.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so what I was thinking, uh…

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Nik Patel: was…

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Nik Patel: Like, right now, this is our setup, right? Like, there are some icons up here.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Nik Patel: I got into this mode where, let's say, this is my portion where I'm doing.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Nik Patel: Human is doing the work.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Nik Patel: This is the portion where AI is doing the work.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Nik Patel: Right? What I was thinking is, we could probably create some sort of, like.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Nik Patel: AI… you know how, and this happens in the technical world at least.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Nik Patel: But this could be, like, uh…

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Nik Patel: Some sort of, like, parameters.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Nik Patel: Where the thought process is.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Nik Patel: this is the pieces of information AI needs to know, right?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Nik Patel: So, like, okay, I care about risk, or…

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Nik Patel: Um, here's what it means, or I want it to be, like, more creative.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Nik Patel: I want, like, my creative skill is one, my…

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Nik Patel: Risk scale is…

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Nik Patel: 0.2. It's okay if it's not, like, 2 discovers.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Nik Patel: Um, so it could… we could, like…

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Nik Patel: And I'm sure there's a better way than this, but…

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Nik Patel: you could, like, tune the AI based on a type of a task that you are working on.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Nik Patel: Um, and we could pre-fill that. It's like, oh, you are doing, I don't know, you're doing a research.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Nik Patel: We're gonna go all in with creative and, uh, information gathering, and…

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Nik Patel: analysis mode, right? But based on that type of mode.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Nik Patel: It knows, like, how to…

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Nik Patel: How to provide answers that make sense for that particular thing.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Nik Patel: And then as for what you were talking about, which was much more along the lines of.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Nik Patel: It needs to know about the company, and risk, and what… who I am, and what I am, and stuff like that.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Nik Patel: For me, that's more like memories section, uh, in the world of AI.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Nik Patel: Which is, how much do I know about you, and how do we start to create that?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Nik Patel: So, ChatGPT has this, like, built into it at this point, if you go into the settings.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Nik Patel: and personalization section of ChatGPT.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Nik Patel: Right? It's got that, so maybe, like, that could go inside that.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Nik Patel: and again, these are ideas that I'm throwing out, but this way we could, like.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Nik Patel: put AI in a certain mode, which…

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Nik Patel: We could derive that, but user may want to, like, say, oh, just go more blah, more blah.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Josh Smith: And… mind if I model that, just so that we're on the same page?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah. I just joined from laptop, just so that I could, like, start.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Nik Patel: Drawing something on paper, in a way.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Nik Patel: Uh, not laptop, iPad.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Josh Smith: Oh, thank you. I'm gonna screenshot this.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Josh Smith: Do you draw with your finger or a pen?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Nik Patel: Pencil, yeah.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Josh Smith: Pencil.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, and my handwriting's really bad, which is why…

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Nik Patel: I'm in a profession of typing, not writing.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Josh Smith: Hey.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Josh Smith: Or handwriting is gonna be a…

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Josh Smith: Thing of a past, right?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, definitely seems like it.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Josh Smith: I know in Japan, like, uh, you know, there's…

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Josh Smith: thousands and thousands of kanji, and um…

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Josh Smith: Kids these days, they don't know how to write any of it, because they just use keyboards, so…

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Nik Patel: It's, um, so…

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Nik Patel: when… when I grew up, we studied in Gujarati, um…

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Nik Patel: And then, you know, then it became English after, like, a certain time.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Nik Patel: There was… so mom and dad still writes in Gujarati, just because, you know, that's what…

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Nik Patel: They have done their whole life. And there are times where.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Nik Patel: Reading is still super easy, but there are times where Anki or I, if we are writing something for them in Gujarati, we have to think if that's the right.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Nik Patel: syllable we put in place, or if that's the right thing we say it, and stuff like that. It's like…

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Nik Patel: If we are in this situation when we spent about 10 years of our life actually doing this by hand.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Nik Patel: People that are not gonna do it, yeah, it's not gonna…

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Nik Patel: It's gonna be thing of past very soon in one or two generations.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. And then it'll just be gone.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I hope not, but yes, it sounds like it's going that way.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Josh Smith: Uh, do you see me in the shared area?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Josh Smith: I mean, sorry, you mean Figma?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yep.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Josh Smith: It used, like, um…

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Josh Smith: project positioned.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Josh Smith: Uh, not that you would do this for Aldi's, but, like…

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it could be, like, we want you to play this persona.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Nik Patel: And it could be, like, instead of these dials and knobs, it could be just a straight-up.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Nik Patel: hey, for this task, I'm acting as this, and you could, like, give it, like, a bit more skills.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Nik Patel: Oh, you, uh, you can select.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Nik Patel: Okay, you can act as, like, analyst, researcher, blah.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Nik Patel: Um, and then…

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Nik Patel: I'll let… you should be able to go do.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Nik Patel: This, this, and that thing, and that's your skill.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Nik Patel: And we need, like, a simpler way to do that, where they're not…

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Nik Patel: Spending time on…

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Nik Patel: tuning the AI, because that's not gonna be good.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Nik Patel: But having that, and now…

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Nik Patel: Going into collaboration mode makes life much, much easier.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Josh Smith: Down the road, do you see there being, within the project, a, um…

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Josh Smith: a…

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Josh Smith: Entry flow into creation of a project.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Josh Smith: that you could do either via voice interview with AI, or written.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Nik Patel: Mhm. Yeah.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Josh Smith: Where, even in voice AIs, it goes…

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Josh Smith: Because everyone hates doing business canvases, even though they're important.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Josh Smith: But, like, if… but in interview, it's like…

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Josh Smith: You don't have to… you don't have to…

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Josh Smith: They're gonna be asked to speak extemporaneously, and they know that they're not going to be perfect in what they say, but they're trusting that.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Josh Smith: AI knows how to get the right information.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Nik Patel: Absolutely. Yeah, and I think voice mode is primary. I've been, like.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Nik Patel: Getting more and more into voice mode.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Nik Patel: Um, even for, like, my coding stuff.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Nik Patel: I'm just, like, talking to code now.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Nik Patel: talking to Cloud Code than typing.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Nik Patel: Um, cause then I can be, like, unfiltered, raw.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Nik Patel: Versus when I'm starting to type, I'm, like, rethinking myself, and it never makes it to the…

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Nik Patel: other side at all. So, if it was like, alright, let's take an interview, let's talk about your project, and they are just, like, giving us raw thoughts, we can start to synthesize that and create a canvas for them on the fly.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Nik Patel: Um, right, and then…

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Nik Patel: that the UI is, like, much more fluid at that point.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Nik Patel: And it's up to us on how we want to go about this.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Mhm.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Nik Patel: In my mind.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Nik Patel: like…

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Nik Patel: And I'm, like, Figma type of canvas is not natural to me.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Nik Patel: But on a notepad, when it's just nothing, it's natural, which is very similar in a way.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Nik Patel: It's just, I'm not…

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Nik Patel: It's easier for me to actually draw a line and then make an arrow out of it.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Nik Patel: then pick an arrow, and then say, here's the arrow on Figma. I don't know why, it's a me problem, probably.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Nik Patel: But going back to what I was thinking, is…

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Nik Patel: in an…

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Nik Patel: in a visual way, when I'm thinking about things.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Nik Patel: It's just, like, this gigantic, never-ending canvas, and, like, oh, this thing's going on here, this thing's going on there.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Nik Patel: If there was visual in front of me, and things were just, like, happening in it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Nik Patel: I don't think it's a bad idea. Now…

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Nik Patel: The problem with that might be…

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Nik Patel: We're asking users to just learn completely new things, and I'm trying to see if that's even a good idea in the first place.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Josh Smith: Um, to learn how to…

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Josh Smith: communicate or converse with AI?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Nik Patel: that, and communicate with the platform too, right? For people, if I…

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Nik Patel: If I think about chat, everyone knows what it is, and they know how to work with it, and they don't have to think about it twice.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Nik Patel: if we start to essentially say, hey, your AI is floating on a canvas, and it's gonna start building, there's like.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Nik Patel: Wait, what? What am I doing now?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Nik Patel: And I don't know to what extent we just say, like, it's worth learning, and it's gonna be…

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Nik Patel: In 10 minutes, you'll be an expert, and then from there on, that's gonna be your life.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Nik Patel: Do we take that leap of faith, or do we not do that?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Nik Patel: Uh…

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Nik Patel: I think ChatGPT moment was that, right? It's like, oh, I could just chat with something, and it's gonna give me answers, and it just can keep going forever, and…

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna be okay with it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Nik Patel: But they started with this, like, one chat box, it's like, okay, I know I can type a message and hit send.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Nik Patel: So it was a family interface to start with, and then from there on, the experience was magical. It's like, how do we… how do we work through that?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Nik Patel: Or do we, even?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Josh Smith: There's different…

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Josh Smith: Or what?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Nik Patel: Or do we even do that? Or just say, like, we're gonna come, you know, work with the current UI structures and standards, and, like, let people start to onboard, and then we'll figure out a new experience? And I don't know if that's even a good idea either. I… just genuine questions, I guess, and answers.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Josh Smith: Do you feel like we are at…

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Josh Smith: So, you know how, like, um…

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Josh Smith: If you build it before you hit the threshold of people who are used to it.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Josh Smith: You become part of helping people get used to it.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Josh Smith: But you're not… you're not generally capitalizing off of the…

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Josh Smith: interest. Um…

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Josh Smith: You're not gaining… you're not… you're not gaining a lot of… it's, um…

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Josh Smith: It doesn't… it doesn't help support your, uh…

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Josh Smith: your growth goals.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Nik Patel: Business. Yes. Um…

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Josh Smith: So you're doing all this effort to help people get used to it.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Josh Smith: But you're not… you…

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Josh Smith: But you're not riding.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Josh Smith: You're not riding the wave.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Nik Patel: Exactly. Um, so yes, I do know that concept for what it's worth.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Nik Patel: what… what I'm thinking through is, uh…

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Nik Patel: We care about this being a business, so definitely want to make sure that this is.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Nik Patel: It's not coming at the expense of growth.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Nik Patel: That said, I think the other thing that I'm also…

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Nik Patel: the… so…

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Nik Patel: I don't know if you have used Superhuman? Have you ever used that product, Superhuman?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Josh Smith: No, I never wanted to.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Josh Smith: Because I didn't understand it, I didn't understand it.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Nik Patel: Okay. It…

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Nik Patel: It's, um, you know, email assistant, whatever, email client.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Nik Patel: I downloaded it because I see them as a competitor.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Nik Patel: amazing product on technically what it can do. For the life of me, I can't actually get.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Nik Patel: to use it, uh, or even if I'm trying to use it, I just simply cannot get myself to use it, just because everything's like, oh, press Command-K, press plus, plus minus, plus this, like, I don't… I'm not gonna remember this, and I don't have time for it.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Nik Patel: But if I do do that, it supposedly is really good on what it can do.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Nik Patel: But I'm not even passing that first stage, and it's like, forget about it, I'm just fine with whatever I can do.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Nik Patel: So this gigantic…

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Nik Patel: shift in how I would operate and how good I can be doesn't even happen.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Nik Patel: For a superhuman side of it.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Nik Patel: Just because I don't even end up pressing Command-K, and I don't even know what Command-K does, even though it's supposed to do some good things.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Nik Patel: So, they are basically doing everything from keyboard, you don't even have to lift your finger from keyboard, and you can do the.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Nik Patel: Old Bing. Um…

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Nik Patel: Like, responding, selecting.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Nik Patel: Prioritizing, remembering, reminders, tagging, sending, all of that you can do in an email.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Nik Patel: All through these shortcuts.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Nik Patel: But that's a whole new system I have to learn, it's like, I don't have time for that.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Josh Smith: when we… when we have conversations, and Beau… Bo can attest to this, I usually come up with, like, left-field ideas.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Josh Smith: I usually bring them up not to say, let's do it, but more to say, um, sometimes, uh…

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Josh Smith: Ideas out in the left field.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Josh Smith: Sometimes break us from…

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Josh Smith: boundaries in our minds. So it may not be like, oh, well, let's do that left field, but it may be like, oh, thanks for breaking the boundary, what are some other options?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Nik Patel: Right.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Josh Smith: So imagine this.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Josh Smith: And I'm being really extreme here.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Josh Smith: Imagine when you sign up for this product and you finish all the integrations, all that happens is that it schedules a meeting on your calendar with it.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Josh Smith: an hour meeting. Everyone's used to meetings.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Josh Smith: And…

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Josh Smith: It knows your calendar, it knows… it knows the best time.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Josh Smith: So, this is… this is our, like, intra… this is our, uh, introduction.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Josh Smith: And imagine you… so you go to the app during that time.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Josh Smith: You have the calendar invite.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Josh Smith: It opens the app.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Josh Smith: And it is a virtual conversation with AI.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Josh Smith: And it's an interview.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Josh Smith: And… you are just talking back and forth to this AI.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Josh Smith: And it's like, um…

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Josh Smith: It's an initial gathering conversation. What projects are you working on right now?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Josh Smith: Oh, that's interesting. Tell me a bit more about this. Oh, who's… who are you chatting with these days?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay. What are your biggest concerns right now?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Josh Smith: Um, work. What are some of your biggest goals?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, uh, are you looking around right now? Do you, like…

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Josh Smith: Are you looking at other jobs? Oh, tell me about what your interests are.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Josh Smith: And… figuring out a way to have this casual conversation.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I've learned so much. Thank you so much for your time. You'll get an email from me shortly.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Josh Smith: Um, and…

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Josh Smith: They get an email right after that conversation.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Josh Smith: And they click the link in that email, and…

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Josh Smith: Suddenly, they're introduced to, like, a full…

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Josh Smith: Like, oh, here's your projects, here's your outcomes.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Josh Smith: here are the people that are important to you, here's… we've got all this information on these people, uh, here's your tasks. Like, they… it's like the entry experience into…

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Josh Smith: Your product is…

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Josh Smith: um… entirely…

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Josh Smith: predicated on something that is familiar, which is having an interview. Maybe not with AI, but, um…

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Josh Smith: These days, it's getting pretty…

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Josh Smith: getting pretty accurate. So that's a left field idea.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Um…

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Nik Patel: Alright, some thoughts on it. So…

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Nik Patel: Part of…

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Josh Smith: It can be terrible. Some… most of my ideas are terrible, by the way, so you can…

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Nik Patel: For what it's worth, um…

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Nik Patel: I had thought of that as part of the onboarding, where I wanted to do voice assistant.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Nik Patel: Right? Where it's like, we will… that's how we'll train you to start using voice more and more.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Nik Patel: So I… I don't know if it's too far away from where I was…

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Nik Patel: Thinking as a magical experience.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Nik Patel: what I think…

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Nik Patel: It's gonna matter, though, is instead of it being a 30-minute, it needs to be 5.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Josh Smith: 5 minutes.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Nik Patel: And it needs… yeah, it needs to happen right away.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Nik Patel: And not, like, schedule a meeting.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Josh Smith: Ah.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Nik Patel: what happens with scheduling a meeting is we have lost them. They downloaded something, they were excited about it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Josh Smith: Mmm…

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Nik Patel: And, like, oh, 30-minute meeting showed up, 500 other things happened before then or after then, it's like, I don't have time for this, I'll do it later. And that later never comes, and we have lost the customer, in a way.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Nik Patel: Um, but what does make it easy.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Nik Patel: Is, like, the way…

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Nik Patel: I'll say what I was thinking, and…

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Nik Patel: Maybe we could combine.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Nik Patel: So my thought was, you log in, or you come to the app.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Nik Patel: You are logging in with your…

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Nik Patel: phone or with your, uh, Gmail.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Nik Patel: Or something equivalent, like, there is an actual SSO type of a thing, right? Where you're not remembering your password or anything. So either it's your phone number, we send you one-time code, and you're in.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Nik Patel: Or it's a Gmail, and you are in.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Nik Patel: If it's Gmail, as soon as you log in, we basically say, hey, thanks for logging in, let's get you set up.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Nik Patel: So now, um…

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Nik Patel: I'm going to start looking at your 30 days of email, but while I'm doing that.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Nik Patel: Let me set you up so that we can start to understand what your meeting schedule looks like.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna give a prompt for them to connect a calendar, and they could connect more.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Nik Patel: Right? Or they could connect more emails and stuff like that. So, like, step by step, they are just doing this process of, like, okay, I'm gonna connect this, I'm gonna connect this. Standard thing, not a big deal.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Nik Patel: What happens is, so they connect the…

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Nik Patel: Email, they connect their calendar.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Nik Patel: And then, they go into this mode of, like, alright.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Nik Patel: I am Priority Lens, and I need to come up with a good assistant name. I was thinking of Lenso, because there's a Lens, and Lenso just works out, but there's a Lenso AI already, so…

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, me, you, me, you…

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Nik Patel: need to think of names. All to say that that voice assistant comes up.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Nik Patel: I'm looking at all of this, I saw that in the last 3 days you have done this, or these are the next few meetings you have coming up.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Nik Patel: Is this top of your mind? Yay nay, yay nay, yay nay?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Nik Patel: Um, right? I say yes, or I just simply swipe something.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Nik Patel: And then that's basically creating what's on top of users' mind day one.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Nik Patel: After that…

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Nik Patel: Based on everything that we have talked about.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Nik Patel: here's the thing I have come up with, here's the people that are top on your mind.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Nik Patel: personal work, here are the projects that you are going through, whatever that list looks like. Here are… here's what your calendar looks like, and it's cluttered, and I can suggest XYZ things.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Nik Patel: Here's the immediate task that you need to be focusing on.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Nik Patel: Let's get to work. And…

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Nik Patel: I think that was it, at least in my mind, that was it.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Nik Patel: the reason I…

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Nik Patel: I did not think about setting up meetings is because then I'm punting that work.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Nik Patel: And when I was signing them up, I wanted to…

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Nik Patel: Have them go through, like, within 2 to 5 minutes.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Nik Patel: Initially, it was less than 30 seconds, but assuming we are doing this interview process, it's less than 5 minutes, and everything's set up for them.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Josh Smith: Um, what is…

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Josh Smith: What is getting in the way from you… what are your concerns with your concept? What's getting in the way from you testing and building out a concept like that?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Nik Patel: Um… nothing's… I…

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Nik Patel: one, I don't know the name that I should say, like, I'm Priority Lens, or do I just give it an actual assistant name that they can call me by moving forward?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Nik Patel: So, that's a smaller, but bigger inner problem.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Nik Patel: Um, I don't think anything's…

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Nik Patel: stopping us. The part that I haven't figured out is how much do I ask them to connect day one, and when do I ask them to connect something more on day two.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Nik Patel: So, if they're logging with Gmail, great, I know Gmail, but I don't know your work.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Nik Patel: So do I ask them to connect work right then, or can they?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Nik Patel: then…

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna ask them for contact, and what if they say no to contacts? It's like, okay, I will not know about it, but we'll try to figure some other way out. I'll look at your emails or something.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Nik Patel: So all those, like, no scenarios and what does happen with it.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Nik Patel: was one thing I hadn't gone through in terms of exercise.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Nik Patel: What I will say, though, is…

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Nik Patel: personally, I like this onboarding experience. In my mind. It's like, if it went through this, one.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Nik Patel: I did not have to think about it. My mind was already that I'm gonna set up this episode while I'm doing it.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Nik Patel: Uh, and it's not, like, too terrible in terms of my cognitive load.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Nik Patel: And third, I see that this is built with voice first.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Nik Patel: So anything that I'm doing moving forward is a lot of me talking with this thing.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Nik Patel: And it's doing all the work behind it.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Nik Patel: So, I want users to get into this habit of.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Nik Patel: What's the right way of saying it?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Nik Patel: if I'm thinking about something, uh, this is where the tap-tap was important for me to build over the weekend.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Nik Patel: tap, tap, hey, priority lens, get this done, think about this, I'll come back to you later. It's like, okay.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Nik Patel: I'm done, it's a notification.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Nik Patel: We'll chat about it when you have that mindset.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Nik Patel: And… the problem that that's solved, that I'm, like, super bullish on.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Nik Patel: is… when I'm in the mindset, getting that mind and context transferred to AI.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Nik Patel: is not happening anywhere, and that's what I think, if we can capture, everything else, can start to be much, much better downstream.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, I told you my idea instead of you telling me. But hopefully, like, you see, there are so many similarities, um…

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Nik Patel: In ways you were thinking, I'm thinking too.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Josh Smith: Well, I would like to narrow in on yours and elaborate on it.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Josh Smith: And…

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Josh Smith: Get to the point where you feel comfortable.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Josh Smith: Testing it.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Josh Smith: Are you comfortable with that?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, I mean, we are testers ourselves, like…

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Nik Patel: I'm using it, um, and I'm gonna give to people.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Nik Patel: I do have the infrastructure set up because of this app. I know how to get this in a format. Very likely, this would be an app format versus a desktop format. It could happen on a desktop, but very likely this will be an app.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Josh Smith: Um, yeah, so…

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Nik Patel: Right?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Josh Smith: Let me… so here's what comes to mind, and maybe you already designed all of this.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Josh Smith: First, uh, I agree with you, I…

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Josh Smith: I hate authentication.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Josh Smith: with a passion.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Josh Smith: It is, like…

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Josh Smith: I want to get to biometrics as quickly as possible, because authentication is the devil.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Josh Smith: Um, but it's like, um, so, yeah, if it's, like, email, or if it's, like, or, you know, a phone number is more like apps, like, mobile-centric.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Josh Smith: Um, so it's like, you know, either email OTP or phone number OTP, I don't know which one you would prefer.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Josh Smith: Um, oh, one… OTP, one-time passcode.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Nik Patel: Yes, um…

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Josh Smith: Or something else, or Magic Link, or…

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Nik Patel: So…

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Nik Patel: any of that could work. Um, I think…

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Nik Patel: two sides to that. If it's a phone number.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Nik Patel: Generally, people don't change phone numbers, at least not anymore.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Josh Smith: Oh, but if it's an email through Gmail, you connect already.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Nik Patel: Yes, then I can connect emails and calendars in my one shot.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Nik Patel: That said, not everyone would use Gmail. Someone might have something else, right?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Josh Smith: Most people have Gmail, though.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, but that… then we are basically saying it's a B2C, not B2B. B2B has to be…

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Nik Patel: connect with your SSO.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Nik Patel: Um, which is fine, too. But yeah, if we could just simply say, you know what, you have to log in with Gmail for now, and it might, like.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Nik Patel: push a few people out, so be it. It's majority of people that's, like, getting taken care of. Or, just give them option and, like, pick your email.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Nik Patel: blind, whatever.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Nik Patel: Like, pick your outlook, or…

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Nik Patel: Gmail, or… I think those are the two big ones that are left at this point.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I mean, Apple's like…

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Josh Smith: hanging on for dear life at the bottom there. It's like…

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Josh Smith: Um, and, you know, you could V1 it with Gmail, too. Just, like, sign in through your Google account. Okay.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, okay.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Josh Smith: In that sense, you don't even need an OTP.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Nik Patel: We do not. Not in this case. We do not know their phone number.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Nik Patel: But it could be just an additional… we will set you, get you set up with, like.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Nik Patel: So one of the things we could do, and this is not thought through.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Nik Patel: Set up Gmail, let's set up your security, because we want this experience to be secure.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Nik Patel: And then we get them set up with a OTP, which is your phone number. It's gonna be your OTP in case you lose something. You could get back in through that.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Nik Patel: And now we have the phone number, and…

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Nik Patel: Face ID setup.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Josh Smith: Damn.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so that's, like, that's your two-factor, then, right there.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Josh Smith: So, of course, that's the boring stuff, but…

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Josh Smith: Dude, it makes all the difference. If you got a shitty auth.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Josh Smith: No one's getting through the door.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Nik Patel: It does, yeah.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Josh Smith: And then, um, so here, whether it's…

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Josh Smith: Web-based, app-based, or both.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Josh Smith: Um, the experience of, um…

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Josh Smith: You know, like, the ChatGPT talk experience where you have this, like.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Josh Smith: really cool…

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, the wavy form, yep.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Josh Smith: Think of that as what this dot is right now.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Josh Smith: Because I'm sure as hell not gonna attempt to design something like that.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. And it's using waves, uh, so it's using the frequency of your sound.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Nik Patel: And using that as a wave, and as it's, like, talking, it's using the frequency of that, and that's what the wave.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Nik Patel: things are doing with animation, I think.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Nik Patel: But I'm sure it exists out there, so we could, like, use it from someone else.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and…

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Josh Smith: One of the back… one of the, um…

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Josh Smith: This is an accessibility thing in instances where they're…

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Josh Smith: oh shit, I did this on a bus, and it's really loud, and I'm turning my audio off. I don't have headphones.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Josh Smith: Um… is, um…

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Josh Smith: Your, uh, closed captioning?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Josh Smith: You're…

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Josh Smith: Now that I'm getting to know you more, Nick, uh, I feel like every time I say something, I'm like, you know, Nick's probably already thought about this.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Nik Patel: This has just been my, like…

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Nik Patel: extremely passionate thing that I want to make, so there is a lot of thinking time that goes into it.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Josh Smith: My name is, and…

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Nik Patel: we gotta come up with a good name. I can tell you what I have on the list, and I don't like any of them. Lenso is a good one.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Nik Patel: Because lens and lens works out. Lens itself is good, so…

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Nik Patel: Uh, welcome to your lens.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Nik Patel: Alright, so that's a good one.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Nik Patel: And this is a cheeky one.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Nik Patel: Welcome to MiniMe.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Josh Smith: mini-me. Now.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Josh Smith: Um, so you're not gonna call this Priority Lens?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Nik Patel: Um, that's too long to say.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Nik Patel: we need one word where I could just, like.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Nik Patel: talk to it easily. So, the product can be priority lens, or the company can be priority lens.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Nik Patel: But the agent itself needs to be one word.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Nik Patel: It could be Welcome to Lance.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Nik Patel: I don't know if Lance is, uh, ever used as a…

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Nik Patel: Name. Yeah.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Josh Smith: Lance. Oh.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Nik Patel: Because priority lands and lens, you know, just…

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Nik Patel: good enough. I'm gonna talk to Lance and just be done with it.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Josh Smith: Alright, yes, I will not, um…

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Josh Smith: I should ask my…

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Josh Smith: I should ask my, uh…

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Josh Smith: My brother, he… my brother-in-law is a, uh, eye surgeon.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Josh Smith: So he's probably got a name of all the things, like, um, because, you know, lens… our eyes have lenses.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Josh Smith: And we put contact lenses upon them, but, you know, like…

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Josh Smith: Stuff like Cortex, you know, like…

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, I like that. Yeah, if you could ask him, like, I'm sure he will have thoughts on it.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Nik Patel: We just need, like, a one-word name that's easy to pronounce.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Nik Patel: And not being actively used.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Josh Smith: Cool. Um, and I'm gonna recommend, um…

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Josh Smith: Uh… serif font.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Nik Patel: Okay? I don't have preferences on that, whatever you say.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Josh Smith: Okay, these are the instances where, like, if you go out and you build it and you come back to me, I would be like.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Josh Smith: Change the… when the copies start showing up when they talk, change it to.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Josh Smith: Georgia. Uh, so because…

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Josh Smith: It's familiar, it's tactile, all print material is usually…

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Josh Smith: serif. Um, it's unfamiliar on a digital surface, but it's familiar.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Josh Smith: in the real world, and when we're talking with someone, and we want to feel like it's more familiar. The details, um…

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Nik Patel: Okay? Yes, those are the ones where I'd lean on you. I have no idea about this stuff.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Josh Smith: And it would have both… it would… you'd be able to either type or…

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Josh Smith: talk. I'm assuming.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Should be both, yeah.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Nik Patel: Type is more subpar experience.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Nik Patel: I think what we'd do instead of type at that point is go straight into the swipe mode.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Nik Patel: Alright, we have found these 5 things for you, is this important, or, you know, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, and be done with it.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Got you. So…

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, so in this one, it'll say, welcome to… welcome to something something.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Josh Smith: Blah blah blah, let's get you started.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, tell me your name, or something.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and that's… yeah, what should I call you? And then that's where the dialogue…

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Nik Patel: Mhm, what should I call you?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Josh Smith: Shows up where they have, um…

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Josh Smith: you know, what should I call you with…

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Josh Smith: That's where the dialogue with the options to make choices.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Josh Smith: And then hit the next. And then…

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Josh Smith: Then it goes, okay, great.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Josh Smith: blah blah blah this. Another dialogue. Make a choice. And it's always a small choice.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Josh Smith: oh, and you're already integrated with Gmail, this is… so, we should elaborate on this, and…

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Josh Smith: Me, personally… what the fuck?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, I, uh…

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Josh Smith: Yes, it's new, you're right.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Josh Smith: I, I agree with you that…

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Josh Smith: It sets the stage on what this experience is going to be.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Josh Smith: It's very minimalist.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Josh Smith: It's not immediately overwhelming somebody.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Josh Smith: It's different from most onboarding experiences, where all they do is give you dialogue after dialogue after dialogue.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Josh Smith: It surfaces information based on what it knows on you over time throughout the experience, so it's…

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Josh Smith: personalized.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Do you already have in mind what those steps need to be?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Josh Smith: You… or is that something we need to lay out?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Nik Patel: In terms of, like, personalization and what that onboarding looks like.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Josh Smith: What's your name? Then after that? What should we call you after that? Oh, what's this? After that, what's this? Do we already have the… you already have the steps?

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, so with Google, I will already get their name.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Nik Patel: Right, so whatever is set up in the profile, so I already know that, yep.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Josh Smith: So you don't need name.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Nik Patel: What should I call you is, how do you like to be called? So it could be, like, Nik Kunj in my profile name, but I like to be called Nick.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Nik Patel: Things like that, right? Um, so that's why that question.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Nik Patel: then… I think what we want to do is just, like, give them a…

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Nik Patel: we are going to go through a couple things today, right? Just, like, set the stage on what should expect… what should they expect out of this.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Nik Patel: I'm already starting to look at your last day worth of emails and last day… 3-day worth of meetings.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Nik Patel: So while I create a personalized experience for you on.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Nik Patel: What is important, let's…

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Nik Patel: Let's get to know you a little bit… let's get to know you a little bit more.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Nik Patel: And then we ask the simple questions on.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Nik Patel: Uh, what's on top of your mind today?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Nik Patel: What are the things that, uh.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Nik Patel: excites you for today, or, like, something along the lines of, like.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Nik Patel: I want to know two things. One, what are they excited about, and how do they do that best?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Nik Patel: And what are they concerned about?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Nik Patel: Uh, and how do we help them get through that faster and better?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Nik Patel: So, um…

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Nik Patel: I had thought of this, and I don't think it's worth it, but I'll say it anyway.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Nik Patel: If we could figure out what's their working style in, like.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Nik Patel: two questions, um, that would be great. Like.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Nik Patel: Do you… are you a last-minute person, or do you like to prep for everything before you go through it?

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Nik Patel: Right? I'm… I'm…

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Josh Smith: Hmm…

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Nik Patel: During the day, I'm a last-minute person. At night, I actually prepare for things.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Nik Patel: Because then, like, I know the context before I go into that day event, which is generally getting crazy anyway.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Nik Patel: So, about 3 to 5 questions is what I had thought of.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Nik Patel: That gives system enough time to, like, review all the emails and meetings and…

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Nik Patel: Uh, people and things like that. So then we show them 3 things.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Nik Patel: it seems like the most you communicate with are, and then, like, this…

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Nik Patel: 3 people, does that look right? Do you want to add anyone?

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Nik Patel: Yes, can you please add this, this, and that person? Okay, I found this, this looked correct, yep, done.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Nik Patel: Um, as for meetings, it seems like, um.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Nik Patel: Or, sorry, the amount of things that you're working on, here are the top 5, does that look okay? Well, here's the project 1, 2, 3, oh, that's not that important, but I want to put this on the list.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Nik Patel: captured. Um…

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Nik Patel: In terms of working with people, here's the meetings coming up, and here's some things that you need to follow up on, does this look right?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Nik Patel: Yes, do you want me to take care of that? Yes.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Nik Patel: Great. Uh, I have prepared a personalized dashboard for you. Here's your dashboard, here's what you need to know, and you're all in.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Nik Patel: So that was, like, my…

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Nik Patel: My thinking, where we are keeping them engaged at all times, till they'll land on that homepage, which in itself should be important enough to say, oh.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Nik Patel: Alright, well, this thing knows what I'm doing, and…

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Nik Patel: From there on, um…

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Nik Patel: We essentially take.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Nik Patel: Probably a day or two, depend on, like, how much work they have going on.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Nik Patel: And then we create a particular task.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Nik Patel: Which is, um…

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Nik Patel: Let's get you, um…

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Nik Patel: doing some advanced things with Priority Lens.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Nik Patel: And here's where we essentially show them, oh, you could do this with voice mode, can you… let's get you set up on what does the double tip look like, because you have to do some stuff on phone, and stuff like… like, something that we can do ourselves.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Nik Patel: Did you know that you could create voice rules? Let's actually create a rule for you.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Nik Patel: And that could happen, like, a little bit later.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Nik Patel: When they have familiarized themselves.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Nik Patel: Or if they had no other task, that's a task where we know their reason to come back.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Nik Patel: So that was… again, it's, uh…

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Nik Patel: it's been my thinking, I don't know if it's a right or wrong, it's good, bad idea, whatnot, um…

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Nik Patel: feels like I would love it, but I don't know if everyone else would love it.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Josh Smith: I think it's worth building and testing.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Josh Smith: Of course, I…

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Josh Smith: Don't have an understanding of the level of effort it takes to create a personalized.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Josh Smith: Voice to talk, to sound and…

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Josh Smith: feel… natural.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna use one of the SDKs that are out there, so it's gonna cost us more money in the beginning.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, but if that gets us, um…

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Nik Patel: heavy use from a user perspective, then we know it's worth it. If it gets poretic usage, then we know it's not gonna spend.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Nik Patel: It's not gonna be that much money either.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Nik Patel: So, there are, like, couple…

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Nik Patel: Voice assistants that are, like, really good.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Nik Patel: Uh, that I'm planning on using, and that would be it, right? If we can see that this is an experience that brings people back, then it's worth spending money on.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Josh Smith: You wanna wire… you wanna wireframe this whole thing out at the end of the day, today?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Nik Patel: Uh, yeah, that actually works pretty good.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Let's do that, and let's get this across the board.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Josh Smith: If you're comfortable with that, yeah.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Um…

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Nik Patel: I am, and I can put… I can then put some time, like.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Nik Patel: Later this week.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Nik Patel: this weekend, early next week, uh, because I'm flying, so I will have a lot of time on the flight to, like.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Nik Patel: think through things, um, and especially when I'm.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Nik Patel: I'm away from home, um…

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Nik Patel: if I'm in a hotel by myself, I can do some coding and, like, do some work too.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Nik Patel: Would it be, uh, over…

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Nik Patel: open to, like, help test this. Like, if I convert this into an app and just, like, get us this far.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Nik Patel: Okay. So…

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, we can, we can wireframe it out, we could look through this.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Nik Patel: I think the…

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Nik Patel: Assume that this portion works out well.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Nik Patel: And we have a, like, really good understanding of, like, alright, these are the questions we need to answer, I can, like, start to go through that.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Nik Patel: Then we are back to that, okay, now we are in homepage.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Nik Patel: How do we want this experience to work moving forward?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Nik Patel: We could probably chat about that, too.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Nik Patel: Overall, I think this is…

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Nik Patel: I like this much, much better than, like, alright, let's just look at a screen and hopefully it works.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Nik Patel: So, I know the scope's changing a little bit.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Nik Patel: How do we work through that?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Josh Smith: It's fine. It's fine.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Josh Smith: This is… fine.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Josh Smith: your startup.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Josh Smith: I wanna help. I'm here to help.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Josh Smith: How about…

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Josh Smith: How about we… are you comfortable with this? How about we just maintain the contract we have? I just adjust the terms to be based on what?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Josh Smith: What… based on arrangement of having more conversations, identifying.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Josh Smith: wireframes I may need to do, and…

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Josh Smith: Making sure that we just get to that outcome of you feeling more confident that you can go straight to starting to build this.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Josh Smith: And we can test it, and I can provide more iterative feedback.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Josh Smith: And… I'll just move away from the whole, um…

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Josh Smith: send me things me… the traditional, I'll call it the traditional way.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. I mean, it can be just simply an email, too. I think we are…

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Nik Patel: I'm good, you are good, so, like, it's not like we need to go through 7 layers of approvals here, right? So…

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Nik Patel: as long as, like, we say, this is what we're doing, I'm fine with it.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Nik Patel: Um, ultimately, I think where it's gonna be really useful, you have a deep expertise and experience in.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Nik Patel: understanding proper structures and UX portion of it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Nik Patel: Right? Which is where…

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Nik Patel: I'm throwing stuff at the wall and hoping it sticks.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Nik Patel: Um, so that's where I think we'd be able to make more intelligent decisions, so I'm looking forward to that.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Nik Patel: And then, um…

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Nik Patel: as we build the structures, converting them, those structures, into UI may not be that big of a deal.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Nik Patel: But one thing we probably, and we can do that later… actually, we could do this now, we have enough time.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Nik Patel: Uh, do you… I'm thinking of, like, choosing some sort of, like, component libraries right now.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Nik Patel: That is out of the box, and just, like, go with them.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Nik Patel: Do you have a preference on what would be.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Nik Patel: Good for experience, or do you, um…

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Nik Patel: If not, I can recommend some that I'm thinking, but I'm curious if you have some thoughts.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Josh Smith: I will… I have a… I have a friend who's… I'm gonna ask him right now, and I will…

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Josh Smith: You don't… you guys don't have a slack, do you?

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Nik Patel: Uh, no, but I'm part of… I've been part of both Slacks so far, so we could chat there.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay, I'm not in… I'm not in a…

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Nik Patel: We could add in there.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Nik Patel: Oh, you're not? Um, I can create Slack, that's not a big thing.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Josh Smith: I don't know what…

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I can ask Bo to… I can ask Bo to get me into his… his, uh, Slack, though.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Nik Patel: Okay. We…

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Nik Patel: We could just text 2 for now, if this is, like, simple conversation for right now, and then it's, like, ready next week.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Josh Smith: Yeah? Alright, I will text you…

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Josh Smith: So I will text you one that I, um…

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Josh Smith: I've worked with some really excellent designers who…

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Josh Smith: um, of some front-end developers who did a lot of effort to work towards, yes, Tailwind.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Yes on Tailwind, um, and then…

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Nik Patel: I have paid version of it, by the way, so I have all these UI components and blocks and everything with me.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Josh Smith: Yes, on Tailwind, um…

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Nik Patel: Then there was shared CN.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Josh Smith: Tell…

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Nik Patel: But yeah, like, if there is something better that is built for AI, um…

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Nik Patel: I'm all for it.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'll ask my friend. Uh, this one's a bit older, but it's, uh…

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Josh Smith: Ant design.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Nik Patel: Oh, Ant is good, yeah.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Josh Smith: Um, but…

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I like…

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Josh Smith: I like sh… shad?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Nik Patel: Shared CN, yeah. That shared CN and tailwind generally goes hand-in-hand.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Josh Smith: Chad.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Nik Patel: So, shared CNs are components built on top of Tailwind itself.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Nik Patel: It's an open-source library, heavily, heavily used, so you see, like, about 100,000 stars on it.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Nik Patel: Um, really, really good at what it does.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Josh Smith: Okay. I'll send these along to some of my front-end friends.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Josh Smith: I say you can't really go wrong with Tailwind, though, so…

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Nik Patel: Pretty much. So, I think 3 questions to ask them. Um, what do you love, um.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Nik Patel: as a library for AI app.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Nik Patel: that has, like, voice mode and AI-first components.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Nik Patel: Second, um…

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Nik Patel: Anything on voice interfaces that they recommend?

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Nik Patel: and anything that works well with React Native.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Hold on.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Josh Smith: Uh, any recommendations?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Josh Smith: on a UI framework.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Josh Smith: um… on…

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Josh Smith: And… Modern UI framework.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Josh Smith: that includes…

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Josh Smith: Component tree…

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Josh Smith: Um, and support for, uh, voice and AI.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Josh Smith: uh, interactions.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, any recommendations?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Josh Smith: on, uh, React Native, is that what you're saying?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Josh Smith: React Native Frameworks.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, well, any framework that works well with React Native, basically it's an AI assistant built with React Native with voice interface as a primary.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Nik Patel: What would you recommend?

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah, I'll ask around.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Josh Smith: Um… I'll let you know what I find out.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Nik Patel: Sounds good, and do you still want to chat later in the day, then?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, if you want to elaborate on this…

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Nik Patel: Let's do it. Um, well, text me when you're around. I think I have a call…

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Nik Patel: My calls end at 4.30, and then there is a 5pm call, but we might not need to do that. I might not need to do that 5PM call, so after 4.30, I'm pretty much open.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Josh Smith: Okay? Alright.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Nik Patel: We could also do evenings, but it's Friday, so I want to be mindful of that.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Josh Smith: Oh, what am I doing on a Friday?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Nik Patel: Clubbing or something, I don't know.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Josh Smith: I am, I'm clubbing on Roblox.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Nik Patel: Ah, sounds fun.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Josh Smith: With my… with my, uh, my boys. I usually play, like, Roblox games with my boys, that's it.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Nik Patel: Oh, nice. How old are they?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Josh Smith: Uh, 9 and 11.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so I'm old enough to, like, have fun with that.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Nik Patel: I'm waiting for my son to get there, it's like.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Nik Patel: once you can actually understand what I'm talking about, we're gonna get nerdy, uh, so I'm just waiting for him to get there.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Josh Smith: How old is he?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Nik Patel: Two, two years.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. Two years.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, we got time.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Josh Smith: Um… Crit, uh, what, what's… uh, you have to jump, don't you?

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Nik Patel: Uh, got 3 minutes.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Josh Smith: Oh. These are the two… two, like, pivotal…

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh, one of the most pivotal shows for my kids.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Josh Smith: Which got them into just, like, thinking… when they were 2 years old.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Josh Smith: Uh, got them to, like, really thinking divergently and, like, uh, but was, um…

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Josh Smith: Um… oh my gosh.
