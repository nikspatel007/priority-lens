00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Nik Patel: I'm sorry, I'm concerned.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I'm good.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Nik Patel: Anky…

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Nik Patel: Junior today called, sir!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Nik Patel: Michael Jorda calls here, construction update.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Nik Patel: Michael?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Josh Smith: Hey, happy Friday.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Nik Patel: Especially the ones glamorites, they go over the Twin Station.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Nik Patel: This is going to need to install those in order to order the custom mirror from those stations, so everything.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Nik Patel: Everything is dependent on those lights that arriving, so try and get those lights ordered next week if you can.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Nik Patel: We'll take care of it, Soreen and I.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Nik Patel: Alright, perfect. And we'll go ahead and release if it hasn't done so already.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Josh Smith: What?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Nik Patel: Can you hear me fine? The first week of January as well.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Josh Smith: What did you say?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Nik Patel: Can you hear me fine?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I can hear you fine, I just hear other people talking.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Josh Smith: So I was just like, I didn't know if that's…

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Josh Smith: It…

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um…

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Josh Smith: Which is fine.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Nik Patel: No, no, no, um…

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Nik Patel: Uh, we have two meetings going on. Anki was in the room, and she has a meeting going on, too.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, that's it. Okay, that's all good. Um, I don't… I don't want to, like…

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Josh Smith: Be too disruptive of that other conversation, so…

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Nik Patel: Doctor.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Alright, how's your day going?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Josh Smith: It's going all right, you know, happy Epstein Files Day, you know?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Nik Patel: Ugh.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Josh Smith: Happy Friday.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Nik Patel: Happy Friday. Uh, doesn't feel like Friday yet.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Josh Smith: Are you… are you working tomorrow?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Nik Patel: Uh, yeah, yeah. Actually, probably all weekend, we'll see.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Josh Smith: Take care.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Nik Patel: With some break in between, but it's not, like, not opening a laptop weekend.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. I'll be wrapping presents tomorrow, that's what I'll be doing.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Nik Patel: That sounds fun. Well, better than what my weekend looks like. Well, that's not true. We… we are…

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Nik Patel: Some friends are meeting tomorrow, so I need to figure out a white elephant gives, so I need to… I do need to do something.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Nik Patel: I don't even know what I'm doing here for white elephant. Just gonna go in the basement and figure something out.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Josh Smith: Oh, White Elephant.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it's like, we're just gonna make it, like, a fun gift versus something big.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, too bad you didn't, um…

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Josh Smith: There is, of course, like, a thing of, like, stupid GIFs online.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah. And I don't even know if, like… I'll see if I can order something that can show up, like, overnight.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Nik Patel: Then it might work out.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Oh, good old white elephant. Now, um, does someone actually, um…

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Josh Smith: You don't actually play with someone wrapping a white elephant.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Nik Patel: Nope.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Josh Smith: There's the variant that, like, if you get the white elephant, you… it's… I forget what happens.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Josh Smith: What happens when you get the white elephant?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Nik Patel: Oh, I didn't know that, okay.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Josh Smith: When you get the white elephant…

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Josh Smith: No…

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Josh Smith: Nevermind. Maybe I don't know how to play the game.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Yeah, yeah, you wanna jump in?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Nik Patel: Yep, let's do it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um…

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Nik Patel: So we talked about the…

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Nik Patel: Uh, screens that we were starting to, like, put together.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Nik Patel: Let me… let me ask this, before we go into that, I see, like, a bunch of… and I saw it last time too, but we didn't have time.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Nik Patel: the variations that you have been building, do you have any preference on what you like and not like?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Nik Patel: Of the logo.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let me, uh…

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Nik Patel: I can…

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Josh Smith: Let me open it up. That was just me, uh, playing around. Um, what was I doing? Um, first, what I did here, uh, I'll look at the colors. So, the color schemes, um…

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Josh Smith: I took, uh… I only took two variant hues, your 212 and 188. The 212 was from your Deep Navy, I forgot what the 188 was from.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then I stratified those across, um, different tonal ranges.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Josh Smith: What that does is that kind of allows you to limit… you can… you can kind of remove.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Josh Smith: a bunch of the other colors that you've created. Uh, what that does is that that cleans it up a bit, because.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Josh Smith: Uh, now you don't have, like, a hue of 171 sitting around, which is a warmer tone.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Josh Smith: Uh… well, actually, yes, yes, and then if you have 180, which is in between the two.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, the higher the… the higher the number, the cooler it gets until it gets to purple.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Josh Smith: Yes, you can.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Nik Patel: Right.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Josh Smith: And then 190, but the 190 is very muted in its saturation, it's very low saturation. I didn't even add that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Josh Smith: dimension here, because then I just… that'd be maybe too much to explain. Um…

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Josh Smith: So, like, in that sense, if you… if you… if you only restrict yourself.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Josh Smith: To a common hue and a common, uh, with a common saturation.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Josh Smith: Across a series of tonal ranges, usually that cleans up the look and feel.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, I only said that because I only started to play with that on these, I think?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Josh Smith: But, um… on… sorry, I started to play with that on the ones down here, I think. Um…

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Josh Smith: What did I do here? This is just me…

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Josh Smith: playing around with, um, how do I get as close as possible to what you have in priority lens?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Josh Smith: While at the same time, um…

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Josh Smith: Setting some, like, uh, some rules around it, where, um, you know, the corner eye, you know, always meets.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Josh Smith: in the top quadrant, evenly. Um…

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Nik Patel: Quarter, yeah.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then I started playing with, well, what if the… what if it was a P?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Josh Smith: So, uh, Priority Lens PL, but then I was remembering you… you really are… are… you're also exploring, like, what is… you're also exploring this, like, idea of yin-yang.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Josh Smith: Uh, in here as well, and how to align to that. So I didn't land anywhere.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Josh Smith: I didn't land anywhere where I'm advocating something.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Josh Smith: Um, I created a whole bunch of variants, um, in case any of these felt…

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Josh Smith: Have any of these resonated with you more?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Josh Smith: if I had to choose one, I don't even know if I could choose one that resonated the most with me.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Josh Smith: Um, I usually stick with anything that's too color.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Josh Smith: And nothing more than that. Um…

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Josh Smith: Just for simplicity…

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Josh Smith: So, as I was designing, I was starting to…

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I was starting to resonate more and more with work as I kept playing around.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Josh Smith: But…

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Nik Patel: Got it. Yeah, I like… I like the… this one.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Nik Patel: and to an extent, somewhat this. I didn't realize it was P, but I think Evernote logo is very common to that, what that P looks like.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Nik Patel: Well, no, it's not, never mind.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Josh Smith: Evernote, the elephant.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Nik Patel: Yes, the elephant.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Nik Patel: Not anymore. I thought it looked familiar, but it doesn't now that I actually see the logo.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Josh Smith: Maybe it was the old logo, let's look at the old logo. No, it's still an elephant.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Josh Smith: So, in case any of them really resonated with you more than what you have, this, yeah, this was an attempt to reduce the complexity of the logo down to something more simple.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that one did resonate well.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Nik Patel: It looks like a comma. Where is my cursor?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, like a comma, right? Yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, um, but yeah, I think last three are probably the most resonating one.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Nik Patel: And then probably the first one in itself.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Nik Patel: Um, is an interesting one.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Nik Patel: Then I was thinking, like, what if we just forget everything and only keep the runner section, and that's the logo, and I don't know if…

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Nik Patel: Anyone has done that either, but…

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Josh Smith: Wait, say that again?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Nik Patel: Just keep the, uh, the top quadrant, and that's it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh! So, like, um…

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Josh Smith: Just this in the circle.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Josh Smith: So that…

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Nik Patel: That's it.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Josh Smith: And then, uh, what's your… what's your, um…

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Josh Smith: Font, do you know… did you choose one yet? Sorry.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Nik Patel: Nope. That was what I was in the branding guide, but no, I have not chosen anything, so it doesn't matter.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Josh Smith: Okay. All good.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Josh Smith: So, playing around… I can play around with variations of that, yeah.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Nik Patel: Yep, and also this last one, where it's, like, double code, which it also looks like P&L.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Josh Smith: And then…

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Nik Patel: is a good way to show that. I think…

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Nik Patel: Somehow we want to bring that, like, human…

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Nik Patel: Machine systems feeling in it.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Nik Patel: I don't know how to do that, but…

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Nik Patel: It does look good.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, this is one where it's like…

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Josh Smith: double quotes, kind of looks like P&L.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Josh Smith: Gets your yin-yang in there.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Josh Smith: You know, it's…

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Josh Smith: Um, it… but, you know, it loses things along the way. It loses the…

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Josh Smith: Personification of the logo into a face, um, but, um…

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. So…

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Josh Smith: This is just me playing, and I may just continue to play in case anything really inspires you, and you're like, oh…

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Josh Smith: let's move full… let's… let's explore even further with XYZ, and…

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Nik Patel: That P definitely does. I think that one, the quote P, looks pretty good. So, like, the ones that I like so far are…

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Nik Patel: The last four and the top one.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Josh Smith: Last four…

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Nik Patel: And then this one as well, uh…

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Josh Smith: Top on that one.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Nik Patel: They have, like, different variation to it, but, you know, those are the ones that resonated well so far.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I may play around with those, then, and do further concepts.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Josh Smith: Just to see where we can go.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Josh Smith: I was worried with this… I was worried with concept like this, because the white started to look like a bird.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it does.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Josh Smith: Like, even especially this one right here, it's like a bird with a tail.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Josh Smith: I was like, oh, that's…

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Josh Smith: The negative space starting, like this one, the negative space is starting to look maybe like a, like a squid or something.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it does. Yeah, like the bird… this bird one, you have to, like, really look at it, uh, it doesn't, like, jump right away, it just feels like a…

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Josh Smith: There you go.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Nik Patel: Like, bolder color in there, but yeah, the bird, once you see it, you can't unsee it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Stuff like that, you have to be careful with the logos if you don't intend it, you know, it's like, uh…

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Josh Smith: Uh, like, have you ever, um…

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Josh Smith: Have you ever seen the, have you ever heard about like the Slack, I'll do it, Slack logo, um.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Josh Smith: Uh, I'll copy it over. I'll be quick about this, because this is, like, not really…

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Nik Patel: Well, for what it's worth, this is really helpful anyway, um…

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Nik Patel: Because as I go into building this weekend, anything that I can start to use from here, color, font, stuff like that, I can start to put that in the system.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Josh Smith: Oh, awesome.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Um, I would recommend, yeah, I would recommend at least that if you're doing, like, a color system.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Josh Smith: Try and narrow it down to, like, two colors.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Josh Smith: Like, if you're gonna… if you're gonna use all these variations of greens, just narrow it down to, like, this one green, this one blue across those tunnel ranges.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Josh Smith: Uh, Slack is four ducks kissing each other's butts.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Josh Smith: And once you see that, it's over.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, you cannot unsee it, for sure. I can't see it now.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Josh Smith: Now it's four dogs kicking each other's butts.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Josh Smith: It's like, huh, alright.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Josh Smith: In the design space, that was the biggest complaint from the designers.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Nik Patel: Oh, really? Okay, well, didn't know that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Josh Smith: Ducks kissing butts, that's all that is.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Josh Smith: All right.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Josh Smith: Um… alright, so over here, we were working on concept.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Josh Smith: Um, we did, like, 15 minutes yesterday, we were like, get this stuff down here.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Nik Patel: Uh-huh.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Josh Smith: Here's what I'm seeing, did I get this right? And then figure out what content would be included in there.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Josh Smith: here's what I can do for you, thoughts, or an example of how I'd start taking care of this, and then the… I'm on anything else you'd like to share.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Nik Patel: Uh, haven't put much thoughts into it since yesterday or Wednesday, um…

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Nik Patel: I think what I'm thinking, if we can get away from… get…

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Nik Patel: Showing today.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Nik Patel: some basic branding, colors, logos that I can just start using as a placeholder.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Nik Patel: Font that you think we should be using.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Nik Patel: And then get the execution view nailed down, and maybe priority view, but even if we don't get to priority view.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Nik Patel: get execution view nail down, and then I'm gonna see how far I can build into that.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, so you want… you want help with colors, you say you want help with colors, logo, and, um…

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Josh Smith: typography.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Nik Patel: Something, yeah. Something that I can start with, and just, like, put that as a skill in my Cloud Code, as I'm building.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Nik Patel: Would definitely be helpful.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Josh Smith: Okay, alright. Um, then let's get your type scale in place.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'm just gonna riff from…

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Josh Smith: Um, type skills that I already have.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Josh Smith: So you don't… we're not recreating the wheel.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Josh Smith: Let me just pull that up, one second.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Josh Smith: Just grabbing it from my files right now.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Nik Patel: No worries.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Josh Smith: Can I recommend an icon system for you?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, please.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Josh Smith: Let's do that, um…

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Josh Smith: Let me get access to it. I already purchased Pro.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Josh Smith: Uh, so I'm… I'll get you into Pro, so you don't have to… hopefully you don't have to pay for it.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Josh Smith: So, I'm going to, uh… let me, let me send you a link right now in chat, so you can take a look at it.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Josh Smith: Um… there you go. And I'm gonna look in my… I'm just gonna look through my files right now.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Josh Smith: To just grab my, uh…

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Nik Patel: Oh, they have a UI kit as well?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, they have a full UI kit, if you just want to pull from that, if you need to pull from a UI kit, too.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Josh Smith: built in… but this is Figma… is this Figma, or is this production ready? What is this?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Josh Smith: I don't know what the UI kit is.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Josh Smith: I purchased their Icon system.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Nik Patel: Got it.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I have Tailwind's UI kit, uh, just gotta see if I can use that or not.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Nik Patel: Um, I need to see if there is a UI kit for React Native in particular.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Josh Smith: Oh, that's why it's not working.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Josh Smith: All accounts, come on.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Josh Smith: There you are. Finally, holy moly.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Josh Smith: Yes. View order.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Josh Smith: Uh, where did I purchase this?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Josh Smith: Yes, sign in. Look me in.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Josh Smith: Take me forever.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Nik Patel: And you said you got, like, some sort of pro version on it?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Josh Smith: Yep, I did.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Josh Smith: Here's my license key.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Nik Patel: access literal GUID.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Nik Patel: Redway.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Josh Smith: Fonts, icons, read me…

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Josh Smith: The Remy gives me everything.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Josh Smith: Eh, it doesn't, but… it's got the license, I think.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Josh Smith: Let me download this PDF and see what this is.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Josh Smith: I'm going to put that…

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Josh Smith: D.C.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Josh Smith: Right.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Josh Smith: Can I send a file over Zoom? Let's find out.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Josh Smith: Yes. There you go.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Josh Smith: Take that…

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Nik Patel: Where'd that go?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Josh Smith: PDFs. Oh my gosh.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Nik Patel: Okay, alright, so we… I downloaded that, just gotta use it from here then, right?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Nik Patel: Is there anything in particular that's good? They're, like, two-tone, sharp, regular, original, mono, original, light fuel, duotone.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Nik Patel: On and on.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Josh Smith: I… I often use…

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Josh Smith: when I was… when I was… when I was…

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Josh Smith: Testing around your, um…

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Josh Smith: your site, I mean, I was using Cute Light.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Nik Patel: Good luck.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Josh Smith: But… but if you want… I was using, uh, light, uh, so either regular light.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Josh Smith: Or cute lights, depending upon the look and feel you really want to give it, um, up to you. You could also do, you know, you could also try two-tone.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Josh Smith: two-tone kind of. Two-tone and light, and you know, of course, they're sharp, uh, so they're less… they're less approachable, they're more, like, professional.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Josh Smith: If you want to be a bit more approachable and soft, use the cute, but I do the light ones, and um…

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Josh Smith: I use that on a lot of my projects, only because it's… for me, it's the most extensive I've ever found.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Josh Smith: They've got… they've got something for everything.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Nik Patel: Got it. Okay.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Josh Smith: Um… and…

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Josh Smith: it, it pulls you away. I'm always, I'm always recommending folks, um, shy from…

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Josh Smith: material…

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Josh Smith: uh, MUI components, or fonts, or Font Awesome fonts.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Josh Smith: Only because they're so ubiquitous… ubiquitous these days, they lack any sense of personality.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Josh Smith: Alright, when it comes to type scale.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, I got one in here, let me get the other one in.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Josh Smith: Think about which one…

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Josh Smith: Has passed…

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Josh Smith: This, I mean, this is an MUI-type scale, um, but I would… I'd recommend at least the scale?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Josh Smith: because…

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Josh Smith: We're getting to a point where…

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Josh Smith: It can serve most purposes, and you're fine.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Nik Patel: Wait, what I… what am I looking at?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Josh Smith: Oh, um, Priority Lens, uh, Figma file, if you just follow me.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Nik Patel: Uh…

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Nik Patel: Ah, there you go, yep.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Nik Patel: And what fonts are this?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Josh Smith: I wouldn't recommend the fonts yet.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Josh Smith: Just the scale.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Josh Smith: Um… yeah.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Josh Smith: And I might recommend the one above?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Josh Smith: I might recommend the one above, rather than the one below.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Josh Smith: I think the one below, it's almost like… there are instances where, like, they have, like, a caption, and overline and subtitle, and then suddenly you get confused, like, well, when do I use a subtitle?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Josh Smith: Versus an overline, versus a caption. And when you're, like, at a startup, that's not… we should not be caring about that right now.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Josh Smith: So it kind of gets in the way. Whereas with this scale, it's like, okay, I get it, I got H1 through 4.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Josh Smith: If it's a title, I use the title stuff, and if it's the body, I use the body stuff. Um…

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Josh Smith: This scale is…

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Josh Smith: You'll see the sizing around this, um, it goes from your body large being 18, your body medium, which is your standard 16 pixel.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then it goes down to 12. So, um…

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Josh Smith: This scale is, um…

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Josh Smith: Sometimes more used for, um…

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Josh Smith: Enterprise products, large sets of data to fit everything in.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, but I think…

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Josh Smith: This could work for you. You could just… you've got bold.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Josh Smith: You've got bold, you've got regular.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Josh Smith: just limit yourself to that for now, and pick your sizes. Um…

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Josh Smith: Just figure out which ones you want to use for labels, if you have, like, form elements, um, and just stick with that.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Josh Smith: As opposed to text, uh, and then of course you write, you build that scale out and then, you know, you need to adjust the scale, you can do that, um.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Josh Smith: Universally. Um…

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Josh Smith: This is…

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Josh Smith: Let me just make sure you know what this is. This is, um…

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Josh Smith: This is likely your line height.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Josh Smith: Um, of course, this is your font size.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Josh Smith: This is your font weight, but font weight, you know, is usually specified in 3, uh, 3, you know, 100 to 900.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Josh Smith: So, you'll just have to, you know…

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Josh Smith: Semi-bold is, of course, in between bold and regular, so, um, sometimes it's, like, 400, 500, 600.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Josh Smith: Um… yeah.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Josh Smith: You know, 400 to 600. Um…

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Josh Smith: And then, of course, this is the, you know, that's your variant name, or whatever you want to…

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Josh Smith: Call it, um…

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Josh Smith: This… let's see…

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Josh Smith: This 0 pixels, that's probably your letter spacing.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Josh Smith: But for this one, it's all zero, so it's like, whatever. Alright, y'all.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Josh Smith: Um… let me… let me do one thing before I recommend that. I just want to go to Material 3 and take a look at the…

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Josh Smith: Typography… typography foundations…

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Josh Smith: If they even have them, if they don't, I'll just be like, what are you guys doing yourself?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Josh Smith: Let's see…

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Josh Smith: Give me a moment…

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Josh Smith: I make this so annoying.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Josh Smith: Alright. This is… so this is… material has, like…

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Josh Smith: Material's, like, 3 different versions of this.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Josh Smith: That's so annoying, but uh…

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Josh Smith: I'll just show you one more variant here, and these are…

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Josh Smith: Display, headlines, titles, labels, and body.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Josh Smith: Okay. That can be…

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Josh Smith: A bit more… that…

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Josh Smith: That's also, though, like…

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Josh Smith: when do I use a headline over a display? I don't even know, you know, like, what's the purpose? But at least with labels and body, you know, body is body text, label is, like.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Josh Smith: Any very short piece of content that describes a body of content underneath of it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Josh Smith: Um, uh, and then titles, you're like, I don't even understand what title is. You know, when do I use title? Is that page title? Uh, is it… what's the difference between title and label? So, I'm gonna delete this, because that can get confusing for you.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Josh Smith: So maybe we should stick with this.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Josh Smith: Fonts.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Josh Smith: You're probably going to want to use a combination of serif and sans-serif.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Josh Smith: I only say that because that's becoming the, that's becoming the writing trend that in more conversational, uh, UIs that, um.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Josh Smith: that the, uh, the AI is… is…

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh, is represented with, um…

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Josh Smith: like a Georgia. So, like, um, you know.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Josh Smith: Let me… let me just…

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Josh Smith: Show you…

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Josh Smith: When I say serif, I mean, you know.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Josh Smith: All the bells and whistles that come with.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Josh Smith: All the seraphs.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and Sans Serif being without serif, which would be your secondary font, which would be, um, you know.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Josh Smith: Gosh, everyone and their mom uses Intern, but, you know, it's, um…

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Josh Smith: So it's… it's vanilla. Um…

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Josh Smith: Uh, I have been…

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Josh Smith: I've been defaulting a lot these days towards system.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Josh Smith: Ew, what the was that? Uh, towards system. Um, what is…

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Josh Smith: What is, um…

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Josh Smith: What is Apple Systems on?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Josh Smith: SF Pro. So, like, on Mac, I usually default it to SF Pro.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, sure, sure.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then, uh, Windows… the Windows system font.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Josh Smith: Um… Segway…

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Josh Smith: Glorious… is it Segway? I don't think it's Segway.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Josh Smith: Is it?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Josh Smith: You're like, I don't know, Josh, you tell me.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I…

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Nik Patel: I don't understand the differences in font in general. I can tell there is a difference, I don't know what's good or what's bad.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Josh Smith: Oh, it's all good.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Josh Smith: The segue is that…

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Josh Smith: Adobe font that I can't download, that's proprietary.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Josh Smith: That's so dumb. Anyway…

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, even if it is, um…

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Josh Smith: Let me… let me ask… let me…

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Josh Smith: Let me get, um…

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Josh Smith: Move ChatGPT. Uh, give me a, uh… let's see…

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Josh Smith: CSS CSS.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Josh Smith: Prioritize in his system phone.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Josh Smith: With.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Josh Smith: I see…

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Josh Smith: Backfills.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Josh Smith: I love AI. There you go.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Josh Smith: So, what this does is it will default…

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Josh Smith: For, like, your second one, your sans-serif font…

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Josh Smith: In my mind, you could test… you could play with this first, because what it'll do is it'll default to, um…

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Josh Smith: Um, it'll default to the system font, uh, which allows it… it makes the… it makes the system feel more familiar and, um…

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Josh Smith: uh, integrated into the rest of the OS, because it…

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Josh Smith: has the… it uses the phone from the OS.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so, all to say you sensitive.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Josh Smith: Use this for, like, use this for, like, um.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Josh Smith: You know, uh, labels, body, you know, paragraph…

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Josh Smith: Content, uh, small, um…

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Josh Smith: Uh, small font size content, most of your content.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Josh Smith: Most of you.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then, um, you're going to want to, uh, experiment with, uh, bringing in a, um…

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Josh Smith: Uh, Serifont…

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Josh Smith: And then it's, uh…

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Josh Smith: use this…

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you know, use this for, uh, you know, um, AI, um…

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Josh Smith: You know, transcription…

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Josh Smith: AI transcription, uh, display, you know, headline, uh.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Josh Smith: Titles that are, you know, larger font sizes.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Josh Smith: Let me pull a good Seraph.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Josh Smith: Will you… will you do this?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Josh Smith: Let me do this again, but…

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Josh Smith: Um, prioritize the most.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Josh Smith: I'll deliver…

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Josh Smith: Venus serif fonts.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Josh Smith: You could start with this, too.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Josh Smith: Try that for now.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Josh Smith: Is that helpful?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I'm sure I'll still mess it up as I build it, but we can fix it after.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Josh Smith: Bye.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Josh Smith: That's fine. So if you do those…

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Josh Smith: Which means, like, when you're looking at this thing right here.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Josh Smith: Why can't I move… oh.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Josh Smith: Can I not move this? There we go. And you're looking at… when you get to these larger, you know, H1, H2, H3, H4.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Josh Smith: Or titles.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Josh Smith: Like, you could probably, you know, serif the larger ones, and then, uh, sans-serif all body.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Josh Smith: All body serif, uh, sans serif, that one.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Josh Smith: Play with that.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Josh Smith: Uh, let me bring the colors over…

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Josh Smith: You could create your two colors right here.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Josh Smith: Have you thought of a… are you going to be using a UI framework?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Nik Patel: I'm going back and forth on that, but yes, I'll have to use something.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Nik Patel: Well, the React one doesn't work out of the box on React Native, so we have to build it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Nik Patel: Oh, there was a React paper.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Nik Patel: Uh, and there was something else that I was looking into.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Nik Patel: Or get me to paper, rather.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Josh Smith: And I was chatting… I think I was chatting with one of my friends about…

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Josh Smith: Shade CN.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Nik Patel: Oh, Sherzin, yeah?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Josh Smith: So, yeah.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Josh Smith: Shad… Shad CN?

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Nik Patel: Yep. So, shared CN's React, I don't know how to convert that into React Native, but I can check it out.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, because you're going mobile… oh, you're going mobile, okay.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Nik Patel: There's something called React Native Reusable.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Nik Patel: That looks like shared CN.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Josh Smith: I see, it's not directly compatible.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Josh Smith: Ugh, that's no fun.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Nik Patel: Nope.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Josh Smith: Native wind?

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Josh Smith: Native Wind, React Native Reusables, or Native CN.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Nik Patel: It's an IT license. Do you like it? If so, I could just go with it.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Josh Smith: Those are the recommendations from, um…

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Josh Smith: What is it, um…

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Josh Smith: ChatGPT.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Josh Smith: React Native Reusables.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Josh Smith: Let's take a look at that.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Josh Smith: Oh yeah, React Native Reusables is pretty simple.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Nik Patel: And then there's GlueStack, which is more…

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Nik Patel: Simpler, I guess? I don't know.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Josh Smith: GlueStack, yeah, let's look at GlueStack.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, GlueStack, uh, yeah, GlueStack looks nice, too.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Nik Patel: Alright, so just pick one off this thing, right? Whatever we like.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Nik Patel: If I go to nativein.dev.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Nik Patel: It looks pretty good.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Josh Smith: For what, GlueStack?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Nik Patel: No, just on… here, let me share my screen.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Nik Patel: So this is nativewin.dev, right?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Nik Patel: And apparently there is this GitHub link.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Nik Patel: So, MIT license, which is amazing.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Nik Patel: And as you go down…

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Nik Patel: there is… there are a number of different component libraries available that use native to achieve different results.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Nik Patel: So Native Wind, Reactusable, and Gloostack are all using native VIN behind the scene.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so let's pick one of the three.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Josh Smith: I'm looking at all 3 of them right now.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna say… no to native Wind UI.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Josh Smith: Well, let me just look a bit more.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Josh Smith: I mean, Native WingUI looks incredibly native and familiar to the…

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Josh Smith: I think it's too familiar to… it's too, like, one-on-one with the OS.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Josh Smith: Experience. Hmm.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Josh Smith: Um… alright, between native, between…

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Josh Smith: reusables, uh, rack native reusables…

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Josh Smith: GlueStack. GlueStack is actually a bit more, um…

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Josh Smith: Approachable?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Josh Smith: I think… uh, React Native Reusables looks very much like, um…

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Josh Smith: uh… it's, um… GitHub.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Josh Smith: Like, if you were, like, code… like, heads down coding, um…

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Josh Smith: it removes all the fluff. I mean, it's… it's very… it's very direct and clean, but I would.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Josh Smith: Probably recommend…

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, try GlueStack.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Nik Patel: So, in ViewStack.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Nik Patel: The pro version is $200.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Nik Patel: Is it worth going to that?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Josh Smith: Uh-oh.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Josh Smith: This is me not… not doing any research here. Okay.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Josh Smith: Let me… uh, where is the GlueStack Pro?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Josh Smith: Only React Native template you'll ever need.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Josh Smith: Explore the templates…

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Josh Smith: Oh, they've got, like, authentic… authentication screens? Ooh, turn dark mode off.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Josh Smith: What does it give you? I just don't know what it gives you. Pre-release, work in progress, buy now and receive free updates for 6 months.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Josh Smith: It's not… okay.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Josh Smith: I still don't understand what GlueScreen gives… glue screen… GlueStack UI Pro gives you.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Nik Patel: It seems like just the components, so if you, like, go to their…

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Nik Patel: Their website and, like, explore templates.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Josh Smith: So, it just gives you the… just…

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Josh Smith: Components, it just gives you components put together.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Josh Smith: in pages.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Nik Patel: Seems like that.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Nik Patel: I don't know how much that matters, actually, because we are not going with… majority of what we are doing is not…

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Nik Patel: Out of the box.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, alright, yeah.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Josh Smith: Don't get it. Access to templates.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay. I don't think… I mean, I don't think you need the templates.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Nik Patel: Alright, safe to say we are going with GlueStack for now. We'll see if we need to change it later.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Josh Smith: Okay. But yeah, one of those three.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Nik Patel: Sorry, one of those three as in GlueStack, or something else?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Josh Smith: Oh, GlueStack, yeah, GlueStack.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Josh Smith: Um… mhm.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Nik Patel: Let me share my screen.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Nik Patel: So I'm looking at this, right, so it gives, like, UIV3.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Nik Patel: The components are all here.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Nik Patel: I guess this is it.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so it already has a type scale.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I can… I can try that out, we'll see what happens.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Josh Smith: Cool.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Nik Patel: Alright, so we are going with GlueStack.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Nik Patel: Uh, what else do I need?

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Nik Patel: That's it, right?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Josh Smith: Um… I believe so. Uh, after that, I mean, it's, um…

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Josh Smith: It's a matter of figuring out your gray tone, and GlueStack might already come with a preset gray tone.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Josh Smith: Um, and this is… this is really just, like, uh, something that can be tweaked over time, just as long as you have.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Josh Smith: like, your neutral scale that you're working with. Um…

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Josh Smith: I'll give you mine right here that I use often.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Josh Smith: But… as you build it out.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Josh Smith: I'd recommend just…

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Josh Smith: Um, feel free to build it out.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Josh Smith: fully in Grayscale.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Josh Smith: Um… and…

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Josh Smith: We can add back in color where…

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Josh Smith: Where color would…

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Josh Smith: be valuable.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Josh Smith: What I mean to say is…

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Nik Patel: Through this.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, what I mean to say is feel free to move faster.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Josh Smith: With just using a scale, a neutral scale like that.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Josh Smith: And worrying about color later.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Josh Smith: Uh, because some of the… because color…

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Josh Smith: The best use of color is…

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Josh Smith: Um, few and far between.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Josh Smith: When you build products.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Josh Smith: You don't want to blow everything up with color. Um, so…

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Josh Smith: Um, to be really intentional about where you place the color, and where you choose the color to go.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Josh Smith: So, um, and this gray… this grayscale, it's not, you know, it's not, um…

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Josh Smith: Oops. It's not…

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Josh Smith: Sure, uh, great.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Josh Smith: Uh, no one really uses pure gray these days, uh, that would be, like, that right there.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Josh Smith: So you notice this has a, um…

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Josh Smith: This is a cool tone.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Josh Smith: To it.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Josh Smith: Everything within it has a cool tone, it complements the cool, uh, primary and secondary colors that you're using, this blue and this kind of, uh…

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Josh Smith: Aqua Teal.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'll just show you, like, different variants. Um, just each website you go to, they're going to…

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Josh Smith: They're gonna…

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Josh Smith: They're gonna drop very lightly, gonna lift their grayscale up to add just a bit of color.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Josh Smith: I'm just recommending if you're… if you're blue here, then just go with a cool grayscale, and you'll be fine.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Nik Patel: Okay. I will give it a try. There will be some learning curve for me here, but I'll…

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Nik Patel: I'll start building and, you know, we can see if it works or not. Um…

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Nik Patel: What's your email address that you're using for your phone?

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Josh Smith: Contact, uh, already, uh, it's either…

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Nik Patel: No, no, no, um, the one that you're logged into your iPhone with.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Josh Smith: Oh, um…

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Josh Smith: Oh, no.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Josh Smith: Uh, it's this one.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Nik Patel: I'll see if I can get the test flight, uh, up and running, and I can invite you there, that's why.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Josh Smith: So, yeah, feel free to pick from the main queued icon set…

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Josh Smith: Sans Serif for body content and labels.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Josh Smith: Sarah for display titles, larger text, larger font that's shorter in size.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Josh Smith: Um, and, um, that grayscale…

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Josh Smith: glue stack…

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Josh Smith: What else do you need?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Nik Patel: I think… I think this is plenty. Now we just gotta make sure the screens themselves are good to go.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Nik Patel: So, all the screens we have…

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Nik Patel: Your onboarding seemed to be okay. Voice options, good. I will not worry about keyboard for now, we'll just go with voice for now.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Nik Patel: Then it's just to test it out, then ask some questions, and then land on that execution board.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Um, what does… so we… we are going with these three, right? Execution mode, prep mode, interval view.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Nik Patel: Are there icons I can choose for that?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Nik Patel: Our thoughts on that?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Josh Smith: Add an icon.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Nik Patel: Just add something that was right.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Josh Smith: Add something. Add something that feels right. Um…

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Josh Smith: My brain was thinking, like, even, um…

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Josh Smith: Let me see…

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Josh Smith: It's, uh… most of my…

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Josh Smith: No.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Josh Smith: No…

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Josh Smith: Ultimately, like.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Josh Smith: Having, um… having an icon set where it's… it's something close up.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Josh Smith: something…

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Josh Smith: something wider out, and then something fully out. But, like, at the same time, like.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Josh Smith: So I was thinking of different variants of that. One of them was, like.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Josh Smith: Tree, forest, eagle, you know, like, or something, like, but…

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Josh Smith: That can come later. Uh, just choose, choose icons, have fun.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Nik Patel: Okay, yeah, that's fine.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Josh Smith: Uh, well, icons are easy to change.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Uh, getting the content, getting the name and icon right.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Josh Smith: Uh, getting the name is more important than getting the icon.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Nik Patel: We want to call it execution mode?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Nik Patel: It doesn't matter, we'll worry about it later, don't worry about it.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Josh Smith: It's… it… it would need to be something that…

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Josh Smith: Your audience is in your audience's language, and they would understand it.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Josh Smith: When they're sitting down, they're in… what are they in… what are they doing? Are they in focus mode? Are they…

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Josh Smith: Like, what do they call it? If they call it execution.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Josh Smith: we call it execution. If they… if they majority think about it as focus time, or…

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Josh Smith: you know, heads down. Um…

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Josh Smith: Whatever that is. And then the prep. What are the… prep is actually a pretty good word, I mean, that's what I call it.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, straightforward, yeah.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then when you're… when you're trying to look at the whole system.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, you could be playful, you call it Eagle, uh, Eagle View, or, you know, System View, or, you know, something… system is not as fun, uh, but, like.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Josh Smith: What do you, you know, so think about that, you maybe ask your friends, what do you call it when you're sitting down? Do you even have a name for it? When you're sitting down, you're trying to see the whole picture.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and you're trying to strategize.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Nik Patel: Yep, makes sense. Okay. Um, as for components, um…

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Josh Smith: Vision, so…

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Nik Patel: How much time do we have? When do we have to drop?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Josh Smith: I'm good. It's Friday.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so…

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Nik Patel: I think what's…

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Nik Patel: We can take some examples just to see that this execution mode will work for us, if we can get through that and figure out what components needs to be built for that.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Nik Patel: screen asset, and I think we are…

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Nik Patel: We are good for the day.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Josh Smith: Let's do that.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Nik Patel: Let me look at my emails too, if you want to look at your emails, and let's figure out what that looks like.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Nik Patel: so I'm looking at just Gmail for now, but…

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Nik Patel: Probably gonna be similar stuff. Uh, well, there's a suggested plan.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay. When you're talking about components, we're talking about, like, when… when it's saying… when AI's like, here's what I'm seeing, did I get this right? To understand, like, what the type of.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Josh Smith: common… what the most common components would be. Yeah, so…

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Nik Patel: I was checking just a few emails to see, like.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Nik Patel: Here, um…

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Nik Patel: Let me share this.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Nik Patel: Actually… let me go to a different one. This might be a fun one to go to.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Nik Patel: Okay, sharing my screen…

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Nik Patel: So this is an email that, um, that we are using. We're opening, like, a…

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Nik Patel: Franchise salon.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Nik Patel: And it goes through, like.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Nik Patel: Bunch of processes we have to…

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Nik Patel: finish. It's two different locations, so you're… and we have, like, 3.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Nik Patel: people that are managing this same account right now, but you see a bunch of it is, like, I'm talking with this particular company, this particular company, this particular company, um…

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Nik Patel: and then we had to get all of that stuff figured out, here's the permit.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Nik Patel: Some credits that are expiring, you know, meetings that we have to do, passwords we have to reset.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Nik Patel: On and on and on.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Nik Patel: the way I'm thinking about this is, if Google has prioritized that email, generally we can assume that it's something that does actually take a priority.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Nik Patel: Google, at least priority-wise, it's pretty good.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Nik Patel: Then promotions, social, and updates, not so good.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Nik Patel: Uh, so that we had to figure out ourselves.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Nik Patel: But for now, assume that I only focus on this once.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Nik Patel: And if you were to convert this into this execution mode.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Nik Patel: How would we go about doing that?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Nik Patel: And if you have your example, we could go through it as well, but that's that, and then if I look at my personal, personal is a bunch of, like.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Nik Patel: here's some franchise stuff, here's the project I'm working on, here's the accountant guy.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Nik Patel: Some more permits for a different location, uh, financial advisor planning, payrolls, um, some more projects, employee stuff.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Nik Patel: More projects, on and on.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Nik Patel: And my updates are a mess, like…

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Nik Patel: This is everything in the world you could think of. Socials…

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Nik Patel: promotions is a mess as well. Generally, I don't even look at this. I'm sure I'm missing something, but whatever.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Nik Patel: Updates, I do care about, like, there are times where I go in and check out things.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Nik Patel: Um, primary is where a lot of the work's happening.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Nik Patel: Let me stop sharing for a second, but…

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Nik Patel: I was just thinking about, like.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Nik Patel: How do we go about…

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Nik Patel: Doing this, you know?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, well…

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Josh Smith: So, here are just some ideas. Um…

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Josh Smith: Promotions and deals.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Nik Patel: And… for what it's worth… go ahead.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Josh Smith: That… mhm.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Josh Smith: That could be hidden somewhere.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, exactly, we don't care.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, like, maybe, like, because this is not email, and if… it's pulling data from email, but if they were like, well, I'm curious what deals are out there.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Josh Smith: You could consolidate that in a deal section and redesign it in a way that it's easier to see, it's easier to, like, parse through.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Josh Smith: And be, like, 40% off at Kohl's.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Josh Smith: Expires in 3 days.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Josh Smith: You know, and you could, like, sort it that way, and be like, hey, um…

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Josh Smith: You know, uh, or, you know, tell us what you're looking for. What are you looking to buy?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Josh Smith: You know, are you looking for clothes? Oh, well, hey, yeah. Yeah, this, um, you know.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Josh Smith: the suit company over here. You're going to a wedding soon. The suit company over here sent you an email that's, like, 40% off. Not sure you, you know…

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Josh Smith: Down the road, though.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, agreed. For now, we just straight up focus on priority emails.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Nik Patel: And then here's what you need to do, and can we start doing some of it?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and with the example of the… your… I mean, so if we use that account as an example.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Josh Smith: What's one action you would hope.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Josh Smith: What's one…

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Josh Smith: Project or priority you would hope they would… that the system would spot in that list.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Nik Patel: So, in an ideal world, what I would want to do is, we know we are opening two locations.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Nik Patel: I want to see what's going on with this location, and I want to see what's going on with this location. They are in different stages of.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Nik Patel: Where things are happening. So even if I can, like, see that, that in itself is, like, 50% stress gone.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Nik Patel: Because I know exactly what needs to be happening here, and what can wait, and what cannot wait, even without AI doing anything for me.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Nik Patel: The second thing…

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Nik Patel: is…

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Nik Patel: There are certain things where people have asked us to do stuff.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Nik Patel: and we have no idea who's doing it between three of us. We are not adding that right now, but at least we could bring up and say, like.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Nik Patel: Hey, this has been… this has come up, and no one has responded.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Nik Patel: What do you want to do about it?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Nik Patel: Oh, let's do this, or I have drafted it, do you want me to send? Sure.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Nik Patel: Um, the other one could be, I don't have time for it right now, can you schedule it?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Nik Patel: Well, we'll schedule an hour for you tomorrow, and everything around this project will all be in that one place, and I'll prepare a meeting brief and schedule for tomorrow.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna mark it, uh, tracking, and we'll worry about it tomorrow.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Nik Patel: Those are, like, simple way to, like… it's just more organization, right? I… doesn't matter right now, I need to take care of it tonight, it's my to-do.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Nik Patel: here's the to-do list, and then it's handled, whatever that might be. But that's…

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Nik Patel: That version of that.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Nik Patel: On the personal email, very similar, that now the project's going to client 1, client 2, accounting.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Nik Patel: Like, internal things and whatnot, and some random stuff that has come up.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Nik Patel: Those are just the projects.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Nik Patel: From there on, it would be straight up, alright, you have received all these emails.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Nik Patel: this guy, Michael, has been following up with you. No one's basically have responded. Here's what has happened. Do you need to set up time with Anki? Or do you… do you want to respond to it? What do you want to do? Or do you just want to say, we'll get back to you and schedule time again?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Nik Patel: So this… this pattern of…

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Nik Patel: it's a problem, you are not paying attention to it, but you need to. Do you want to pay attention now, or do you want to schedule time and pay attention then?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Nik Patel: and then once you schedule it, at least it's stress off, I'll worry about it when time comes.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay, and what I'm hearing, uh, and tell me if I'm wrong, what I'm hearing is, as, like, a first step.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Josh Smith: Not necessarily AI being like, would you like us to do all of this stuff for you, like, would you like us to.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Josh Smith: Take care of this problem for you, but it's more like.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Josh Smith: we notice a task needs to be done. Who would you like having it… who would you like to have it done?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Josh Smith: Would you… would you like to tackle it? Would you like to… you know, to let everyone know that you're tackling it? Would you like to schedule it?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Josh Smith: And… okay.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Nik Patel: It's, yeah, grouping, scheduling, tackling.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Nik Patel: And then it goes back to what we were talking about. It's like, well, I want Anki to take care of it. Okay, well, I'll track it for now, I'll send an email to Anki.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Nik Patel: And I'll follow up if it's done or not, and then whatever happens, happens after.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Nik Patel: And that goes into AI tracking more again, you know?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Josh Smith: Okay. And then, eventually… and then, so, like, once you're done with the execution mode.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Josh Smith: As your first entry.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Josh Smith: As part of the, um…

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Josh Smith: the Eagle view, it should probably be, like, project… project A.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Josh Smith: Short history…

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Josh Smith: goal.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Josh Smith: Current state, Anki's taking care of it.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, something along those lines, yeah.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha, okay.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Nik Patel: Um, and again, this is my view of it. I'm sure you have a completely different view, or very similar view.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Nik Patel: I'm trying to see how much of this pattern applies, if we were to do this, how much of this pattern applies for everyone?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Josh Smith: because where I'm…

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Josh Smith: when you initially asked, like, what should happen, what should AI do, my brain is always like.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Josh Smith: since I'm a little done with the back end, it's like, well…

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Josh Smith: how are you gonna build… are you gonna build this in a way that you're gonna see what AI does?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Josh Smith: Or do you have to, like.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Josh Smith: guide AI very specifically to figure out all of these different permutations of what it's seeing.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Josh Smith: Can you just have it analyze and feedback stuff to you?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Josh Smith: And then make assessments on what it's seeing.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Nik Patel: Yes, that's what I'm thinking that we do.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Nik Patel: We'll try to, like, auto-label some of those things, and then we'll ask…

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Nik Patel: Users are like, okay, well, it seems like here's the project, and here's the common people that talks about this common topic.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Nik Patel: is there one project? Sure, it is. Uh, here's, like, similar common people, but different topic.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Nik Patel: Is there a common topic? Like, those type of grouping is what I'm hoping we can do as AI ourselves.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Nik Patel: and then they can say, well, here's how I'll rank them, and it's like, alright, here's your top 3, now I know what to do with it, and we can start to, like.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Nik Patel: Move you forward.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. It's in, like, for this one, through this, uh…

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Josh Smith: So, like, in…

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Josh Smith: In, uh, the concept here.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Josh Smith: This is just a con… this might not be doable.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, I don't know if you're on, um…

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Josh Smith: If you're on Figma right now, looking.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Nik Patel: I'm looking yet.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Josh Smith: Alright, cool. So, like, imagine if it's, like, um…

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Josh Smith: I'm just gonna…

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Josh Smith: I'm not gonna design it, I'm just gonna say this is a…

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Josh Smith: You know, calendar…

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Josh Smith: There's, like, a calendar here with maybe, like.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Josh Smith: you know, like…

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Josh Smith: And then it's just, like, um…

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Josh Smith: you know…

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Josh Smith: I don't know what this would be. It would be like, um…

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Josh Smith: Project name, you have the test name, you have, um…

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Josh Smith: Um… you know, your project length, like…

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Josh Smith: Or project duration…

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Josh Smith: Like, how long it's taken so far…

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Josh Smith: You have a goal.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Josh Smith: Like, so goal, maybe, ultimate goal outside of the task, maybe it's the task itself.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Josh Smith: If you have to… if the next thing is to schedule.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, if it's like, oh, you have… you're planning for a wedding, or you're planning for a meeting tomorrow at 3.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Josh Smith: You could have, like, um…

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Josh Smith: A clock, a visual component of a clock.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Josh Smith: That just says, like.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Josh Smith: you know…

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Josh Smith: 3 PM…

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, but, like…

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Josh Smith: This is where, like… and then you could have, like, the key players over here.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Josh Smith: you know, um…

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Josh Smith: Bob…

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Josh Smith: Title…

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Josh Smith: Now…

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Josh Smith: Maybe Bob has a nice photo, even, that we found.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Josh Smith: But, like…

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Josh Smith: Uh, maybe there's files that were downloaded.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Josh Smith: And… we have…

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Josh Smith: Images of those files…

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, now, whether or not all of this is on the screen at once, but the idea of, like, if the format returns all of these common things.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Josh Smith: If the, if, if the way it's analyzing, it'll always, it'll always return, like, alright, yeah, here are the people.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Josh Smith: Uh, here are the files. Um, let me add…

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Josh Smith: Let me add up.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Josh Smith: Come on, you stinker.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Josh Smith: Stroke on you, so that you are visible.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Josh Smith: You know, like, here's, like, images.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Josh Smith: like, like, image captures of PDFs or PNGs that were sent.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Josh Smith: and they're all, like, structured, like, I found these. Um, even if, like.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Josh Smith: As… as the, um…

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Josh Smith: As AI is chatting.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Josh Smith: Even if it's, like…

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Josh Smith: As it spins them up.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Josh Smith: Even if it's doing, like, one at a time.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Josh Smith: you know…

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Josh Smith: Even if it's, like, one at a time, even.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Josh Smith: Uh, so it doesn't, like, clutter the screen.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Josh Smith: But the idea of, like, the components, like, popping up…

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Josh Smith: This is down the road, maybe, but it's, like, like, animated, like…

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Josh Smith: like, oh, here's what we know, here's what we're… here's what we're seeing. Um, you know, uh, you have a project, uh, I've analyzed the following files.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Josh Smith: You know, um, your key players in this are, are this, uh, these are the, these are your key players, or the people.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and, uh, it looks like the next thing someone needs to do is schedule the event.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Josh Smith: Which, uh, which is at 3.30, um, and, um…

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and the last person… the last person that was asked to do that, uh…

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Josh Smith: you know, uh, was you. Um…

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Josh Smith: Um… and it hasn't been done yet.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Josh Smith: So… that was just one idea. I know that's, like, out there.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Nik Patel: code.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Nik Patel: Is that an execution mode, though? That's what I was trying to figure out, right? Like, this is more, like, eagle mode.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Nik Patel: Here's everything that's going on.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Josh Smith: So, for the…

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Josh Smith: For the task, well, give me an example of a task.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Nik Patel: Let's see…

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Josh Smith: Because you're right, that…

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Nik Patel: An informational message is available in…

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Nik Patel: my Texelino account.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I need to go check out what that is. System can do it, but…

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Nik Patel: I need to go check it out, right?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Nik Patel: Um, the other one is probably… you have an invoice from Salon & Spa Ultimate.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Nik Patel: Well, gotta pay for it, or no? What are you… what are we doing with it?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so let's look at that one.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Josh Smith: You have an invoice.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then it's like, you know, due Wednesday. We've…

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Josh Smith: You have an invoice.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Josh Smith: So this is, like, in the instance we know there's an invoice.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Josh Smith: Not that it would look like this.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Josh Smith: but due Wednesday…

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Josh Smith: It's $999.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Josh Smith: you know, like…

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Josh Smith: It wouldn't necessarily be skewed like this. Do Wednesday, $999.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Josh Smith: you know, but, like, showing the invoice image, saying we processed it, it's due Wednesday, uh, 99 bucks, and the available options… we actually pulled the available options, and…

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Josh Smith: There's, uh, there's a pay link.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Josh Smith: Um, that we found in there. Uh, do you want to do it now or later?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Josh Smith: Is that kind of…

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that's awesome thing, like, pull out the pay link or something, and then have them click on it, and then they can pay it and come back and say it's done.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Josh Smith: So, it would look like that.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Josh Smith: And, like, pay now. Um, and the AI could even be, like.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Josh Smith: You want to pay now?

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Josh Smith: If you want to pay now, click on the button, you can pay now, or let me know, I can remind you. Would you like me to remind you, like, the day before it's due?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Josh Smith: And then you can talk back, yeah, say, could you remind me, like, the day of…

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Josh Smith: Uh, I'll pay it then, because the payday is the day before that.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Josh Smith: Got it. Great, I will remind you.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Josh Smith: Um… so, something like that.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah. I think that's cutting much, much closer, right? Because now I'm not going into this email.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Nik Patel: inbox, I'm essentially getting work done.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Nik Patel: Or deciding not to get it done and pushing it, but it's a conscious decision.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Josh Smith: So, it'd be like, you know.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Josh Smith: Thunder Mifflin…

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Josh Smith: you bought…

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh… giant ream of paper.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Josh Smith: Do Wednesday.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay. So, this model could be, like, you have…

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Josh Smith: An object that represents…

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Josh Smith: An object that represents the… the task.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Josh Smith: Content. Mm-hmm.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Nik Patel: Well, even simplifying that further, it seems like the… so, not simplifying, actually, just thinking technically.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Nik Patel: We look at all the attachments, see if any attachment has any meaning, show those attachments where they could click on it and view it.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Nik Patel: Right? And take an action.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Nik Patel: Or just tell them, here's the attachment, here's the action, here's your options, what's next?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Nik Patel: That's the… that's the, uh, framework we are following, right?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yeah, you could do that.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Nik Patel: In my mind, what I'm thinking is, like.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Nik Patel: what do I need to prompt? What data do I need to put in? And this is more technical than experience, so that's on me, but…

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Nik Patel: Essentially.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Nik Patel: Are we looking at an email, looking at the summary, and saying, here's what has happened, here's what needs to happen now, here's what we found?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Nik Patel: Do you want to review that right now?

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Nik Patel: Or do you want to take the action now? Here's the action you could take, or do you want to defer it? If so.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Nik Patel: Um, it's, like, scheduled…

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Nik Patel: Remind blah, set up time, or whatever.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Nik Patel: So, we just need to build those components, essentially, right? I can build, like, attachment component, calendar component, time component.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Nik Patel: Something. Sorry, something.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and tell me if I'm off on this, but I'm assuming that…

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Josh Smith: Invoices due is common enough that you could represent it commonly any time you know an invoice is due.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Josh Smith: So that helps, because then we can refine that over time. Be like, what's the most important information?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Nik Patel: Right.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Josh Smith: Could we set… could we show them an image of the invoice if we have it instead? Could we show them an… do we just need to show them.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Josh Smith: you know, look at attachment. Um, but that's one. But I'm assuming there's dozens.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Josh Smith: So it's just, like, looking at that…

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Josh Smith: Task by task, and designing what that should look like, uh, in execution mode, in, like, the simplest way possible.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Josh Smith: Um, and if I can… where I'm helpful is if I know exactly what those are.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Josh Smith: So, yes, the invoice one, yeah, yeah, let's… we can design that. Um, so as you go through, and you're, like, figuring out with AI, like, oh.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay, yeah, here's… oh, I'm noticing, like, here's the top 5 that are always happening. Yeah, let's design those.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Um, what I'm thinking through, and this is way out in the future.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Nik Patel: But what I was thinking through is, uh, going back to that marketplace concept.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Nik Patel: people could essentially create this type of things. It's like, here's the invoice due, here's how a system can notify it, here's what it looks like, and here's the actions that are available to you.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Nik Patel: Everyone start building your components, and we'll, like, start injecting them, labeling them, and based on that label.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Nik Patel: here's what we show. So it's, like, community driven in a way.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Josh Smith: Ah, I see. So being able to build something like that, where you can ask the agent to go identify.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Josh Smith: Whenever there's an invoice, feed me back this information.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Josh Smith: So, almost… okay, so what I'm hearing is, like, if you're able to build.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Josh Smith: The simplest versions of these.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Josh Smith: And then you know, though, that there's a trajectory of this where it could get better and better.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Josh Smith: But it's… you provide the tools for your users to be able to improve them.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Nik Patel: even… even developers, right? Developers could put it in and say, like, alright, I want to install, and we could say, like, oh, I found this marketplace.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Josh Smith: Even developers.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Nik Patel: component in there that looks like this, do you want to, like, install that on your sense? Like, sure.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Nik Patel: It's like installing an app on your phone, right, that does some particular thing for particular stuff.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Nik Patel: But it's happening within the system. Again, that's way out there, but then we are not responsible for… responsible for building all components ourselves.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Nik Patel: We are providing a mechanism that anyone can build off of.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Josh Smith: And it's almost like the Zapier of, uh…

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Josh Smith: Of, uh, automations from email.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, pretty much.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Josh Smith: Which is interesting.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Josh Smith: Alright, that's cool.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Now, very likely, I think the way this is going is…

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Nik Patel: We are essentially getting to, here's the information, here's your to-do task, here's the action you could take right now.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Nik Patel: Do you want to take them now, or do you want to do something with it later?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Nik Patel: And we need to essentially have UI components for those. If we have those components, then it's a quick ENA, ENA, ENA, I have done it, done, done, move on, whatever.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Nik Patel: Then the question… so then I think what we can do is…

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Nik Patel: We can…

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Nik Patel: convert that into a to-do task, that they could go back and just, like, not even need to worry about execution mode in this format. It's a to-do click, click, click, click on it, and then it takes them to…

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Nik Patel: Detailed information and start to knock it out as if it was a simple to-do, but the to-do task is created for them.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Nik Patel: Because of their action, we know this and deal with it later, okay, it's going up here, and this is what it means.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Um, and…

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Josh Smith: The play between…

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Josh Smith: Me taking an action…

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Josh Smith: An actual action, me asking for that action to be taken.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Josh Smith: I think we'll have to work through that, because, like.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Josh Smith: Deal with it later could prompt… after that, like, what does that mean, right?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Josh Smith: Whereas, if I were just chatting with it, I could just be like.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, just remind me.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Josh Smith: Remind me to take care of this.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Josh Smith: You know, the day before.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, if we want to make, like… so, that's, like…

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Josh Smith: Where we'll have to figure out, like.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Josh Smith: If they say deal… if they click deal with it later, rather than saying something.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Josh Smith: does that just… does the… does the AI just say, okay, we'll remind you the day before?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Josh Smith: You know, is it…

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Nik Patel: I think Dilberth later would simply say, uh, I have created a to-do task for you.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Nik Patel: You could check it out later, or here's the option for you to schedule, and the screen changes to that.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Okay.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Nik Patel: Right?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Josh Smith: Okay?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Nik Patel: So…

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Nik Patel: I think this is good, I'll… I'll…

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Nik Patel: what I'm gathering so far is, figure out someone to log in.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna ask for 3 permissions, drive, calendar, emails, read, write everything, which probably will freak out people, but so be it for now.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Nik Patel: They come in, we take them through this voice experience, we have done some grouping, done some labeling.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Nik Patel: Um, we show them, here's what we have found, does this make sense? Sure, great.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Nik Patel: Based on what I have seen so far today, here's the things that needs attention, here's your options.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Nik Patel: if we can get that far, which going that far in a weekend's gonna be fun, but even if I can get it that far next week, I think that would be amazing progress.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Josh Smith: Okay, keep me updated along the way, uh, whatever you need, if you need feedback on the UI and stuff, uh, since I'm…

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Nik Patel: Uh, when are you gone? You're gone from 24th onward, right?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I'll be around. I'll be around.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Okay.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Nik Patel: Um, yeah, I'll, um… I'll work on it a little bit. If you can think of, like, these components, so this is where I could use your help on.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Nik Patel: let's find libraries. So, like, for example, if we now go back to GlueStack or whatever.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Nik Patel: does GlueStack have these components that we can start to use out of the box? So it doesn't have…

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Nik Patel: doesn't seem like it's got calendar view, so I need to figure out where to get the calendar view from, right?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Josh Smith: I'd say it's totally case-by-case on what these… what these general tasks are, these types of tasks.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Nik Patel: Right, but calendar selection, some of those are pretty simple, or…

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Nik Patel: Common is probably the best way to put it.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Nik Patel: So I can look through this, like…

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Nik Patel: What I'm thinking is, do I spend a little bit more time on, hey, we are going to create, like, 5, 7 different types of components? So for now, based on what you have, our components are attachment component.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Nik Patel: Calendar component.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Nik Patel: people component.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Nik Patel: action component. Also, uh, can you write that somewhere? I don't know if I can.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Josh Smith: So, like…

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Josh Smith: for instance, like, GlueStack has…

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Josh Smith: an avatar…

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Nik Patel: Yes, it's got that, yep.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Josh Smith: It's got… so BlueStack has that, you know, like…

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Josh Smith: Um, and even if it doesn't have… even if you can't… they can't find the photo of the person, you can put, like, the JS there, you know, the initials.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Nik Patel: Just, yeah, just the first last year.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Josh Smith: Let's see, what else does GlueStack have? Let me… let me see if I can…

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Josh Smith: Components, components… come on… VStacks, 8 stacks, cards…

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Josh Smith: I've got cards.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Josh Smith: Do you have a calendar? You don't have a calendar.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Josh Smith: Don't have a calendar, okay.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Josh Smith: I mean, you don't even honestly…

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Josh Smith: do you need a calendar, right? We don't even need a calendar right now, you could just do it with design with content.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Josh Smith: How about this? Let's… let's see if we can design with content.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Josh Smith: If you… if you let me know what content.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Josh Smith: gets returned.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Josh Smith: I'll…

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Josh Smith: Design those with typography in a way that just looks really clean.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Nik Patel: Sure, that works.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Josh Smith: Start. Let's do that to start.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Yeah, because, um, and it doesn't even, like, from the way I'm thinking it, it doesn't even have to be just GlueStack.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Nik Patel: We just need to go find something that does look like a calendar component and inject that, or whatever, you know?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Nik Patel: But, yeah, that makes sense.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Nik Patel: So, where are you now?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let's start with typographical styling, because we could do a lot with that as it is.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then inject…

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Josh Smith: supporting visuals.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Josh Smith: After that.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Josh Smith: Just to get it moving.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Alright, um, I can… yeah, I can…

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Nik Patel: I don't know if we need… I'm up for doing it right now, but we have already been at this for, like, an hour and a half.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Nik Patel: Um, do you want to do it now, or should I take a first stab at it and then come back and we can fix it later? It's styling after all.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Josh Smith: For styling? So, for instance, like, for this, for, uh… let me copy and paste this over here. So, like, for this.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Josh Smith: Um… if we… if we were centering everything…

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Josh Smith: Let me…

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Josh Smith: And we were using, uh… I'm gonna use SF Pro…

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Josh Smith: Gotta default all these to SF Pro, give me a moment.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Josh Smith: Just to represent what it would look like.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Josh Smith: Gonna watch me play a bit.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Josh Smith: I don't…

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Josh Smith: All this to…

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Josh Smith: 100…

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Josh Smith: And you might not even be able to say giant ream of paper, because these invoices might have.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Josh Smith: That might be itemized.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Josh Smith: Like, there might be no one subject for what it was.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, and I think…

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Nik Patel: we could even go as far as, here's the attachment, you can open it and it just opens in a PDF viewer.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Nik Patel: Right? Or just whatever doc we were.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Nik Patel: It's like, hey, you got this, here's what it is, do you want to review it?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, let me look at it, makes sense. Here's the content, so…

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Nik Patel: Maybe the way it might work out is, here's what has come up, here's the context, here's the action, here's the information.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Nik Patel: here's the decision. Like…

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Nik Patel: too much stuff, but, like, somehow, like, combine all of this into UI?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Nik Patel: And that does it.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, so to that regard…

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Josh Smith: Say that again, um…

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Josh Smith: Here's the… say it again.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Nik Patel: Here's what has come up.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Nik Patel: Here's the context.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Nik Patel: Here's the information, like, attachments and stuff.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Nik Patel: Here are the action options, and here's your decision options.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Nik Patel: I guess action and decision could be combined.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Nik Patel: If we keep just 4.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Nik Patel: Because that would apply every single time, right?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Nik Patel: Also, before I forget, um…

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Nik Patel: We will need a way for us to, like.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Nik Patel: Somehow allow them to input the information in the system.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Nik Patel: That is not related to email or anything.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Nik Patel: Hey, I talked to Josh, and I need to remember this, or it's going into your to-do. Like, some…

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Nik Patel: Mood of that.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Nik Patel: We can rewrite it later, though.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Nik Patel: That's what I use my to-do for.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Josh Smith: Okay, oh, yes, yeah, the thing you built.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Josh Smith: that I'm assuming is going to just be part of…

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Josh Smith: This tool eventually, or…

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Nik Patel: Eventually, yeah. Yeah.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Josh Smith: This should go above…

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Josh Smith: This is where the what has come up context, information, actions, decisions. If I have a giant dump of, like.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Josh Smith: all, like, content around, here's everything that AI can spit out on what has come up, here's everything AI can spit out in context, here's everything that AI can spit out on information.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Josh Smith: and here's all the actions and decisions. That'll give me some fuel to start, like.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Josh Smith: Like, to design these better, if that makes sense.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Yeah, and let me… let me go through, like, actually ingesting the data.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Nik Patel: and I can start to see, like, what type of things are coming up.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Josh Smith: Because then I could be like, okay…

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Josh Smith: You know, the format is always going to be this or something, you know?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and if it's… if this… if this is all the type of content, this is how we can design that specific content.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Josh Smith: And then, uh, go from there.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Okay, yeah, this helps. Um…

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Nik Patel: I think I can… let me… let me at least get it to a point where I can show, like, 3 or 5 tasks, and we can see, like, alright, well, this looks good, and now we can make this much, much better. It's a common enough task type of thing.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Nik Patel: Because we could have, like, common enough tasks and some sort of, like, catch-all, which just follows a particular format and.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Nik Patel: Just goes from there.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Josh Smith: Alright, one second.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Josh Smith: Maybe if you wanted to make it a card, you could make it a card.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Josh Smith: Ugh.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Josh Smith: Where, you know…

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Josh Smith: you know.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Josh Smith: And if you wanted to, I mean, if all the content was minimal enough.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Josh Smith: And you could… you could…

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Josh Smith: card them.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Josh Smith: Even to the point where, like, if you… oop, oh.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Josh Smith: Um… this is… this is more gimmicky, but like…

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Josh Smith: Come on.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Josh Smith: You're not supposed to do that when you scale, y'all.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Josh Smith: Well, it's gonna look nasty.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Josh Smith: But…

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, just like, here's what you are, just swipe, swipe, swipe.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Josh Smith: Swipe, swipe, swipe. Yep.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Josh Smith: So… I mean, it looked much better than what I just did here, but you… you get it.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Alright, let me play with it. I'll, um… I can just convert that into a card and figure out what to do with it after.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, sure.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Nik Patel: Great, this has been really helpful, appreciate it. Uh, now it's time to code this weekend, and I'll let you know how it goes.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Thanks, man.
