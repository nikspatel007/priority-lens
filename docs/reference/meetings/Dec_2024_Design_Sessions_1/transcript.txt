00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Nik Patel: Hey, Josh.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Josh Smith: Oh, hey!

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Nik Patel: Can you hear me fine?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Josh Smith: Can hear you now, yeah.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Nik Patel: Awesome.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Nik Patel: How are you doing?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Josh Smith: Doing okay, thanks.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Nik Patel: Oh, you sound much better, so I'm assuming you're feeling a bit better?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Josh Smith: Slow recovery, yeah, slow recovery.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Josh Smith: Um, I still have been in, like…

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Josh Smith: Brain fog for like head colds for like.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Josh Smith: Over a week now, but…

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Josh Smith: Uh, at least my voice doesn't sound like I'm…

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Josh Smith: Uh, near death, yeah, so…

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Nik Patel: You sound much better, I'm hoping it just gets better from here.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, thanks. How you been?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, good! It's, uh, it's been a busy day, um…

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Nik Patel: So, um…

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Nik Patel: I may have a hard stop, I'm trying to figure out if I'm gonna have a hard stop or not.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Nik Patel: But I'm glad you dive in, uh, when you are.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Josh Smith: Alright, let's dive in.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Nik Patel: Do you mind if I make up the call?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Josh Smith: Do I mind if you record the call?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Josh Smith: No.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Nik Patel: Ah, that's a long thinking, huh?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Josh Smith: No, I don't mind at all.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Nik Patel: I know, just kidding. Um…

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Nik Patel: Give me one sec, I'm trying to adjust my camera.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Nik Patel: Doesn't work, okay.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Nik Patel: Mission stuck…

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Nik Patel: Here we go, I guess that's better.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Nik Patel: Let me record, and then let's get started. Um, the sound comes out fine. I changed where my mic is.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I think so.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Nik Patel: Alrighty, uh, going back to Figma, then?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Nik Patel: Uh, where do you want to start?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Josh Smith: Well, I don't know if you wanted to talk about that thing you sent me, um…

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, I could, um… there is not much there yet.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Nik Patel: It seems like it's a daily brief, and… but it… they're moving in the same direction that we are, uh, just a completely different.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Nik Patel: Uh, approach.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, they are. Um…

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Josh Smith: What they're doing here is, like… and I'm gonna break out these objects, because this might be helpful for us. Um…

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Josh Smith: Top of mind… they're top of mind, um…

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Josh Smith: It's a combination of like 4 things, kind of. They have the action, they have, um.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Josh Smith: amount of time it would take, which I don't know if you'd want to leverage. I was assuming no.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Nik Patel: I don't trust, uh, anything AI says it's gonna take, right? Like, especially how fast things are changing.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Nik Patel: Things that used to take a month takes hours, things that used to take hours takes months, and it's… there is just, like, not a reliable way on it right now.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I was thinking the same, I was like, this…

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Josh Smith: Who, who decided to add that one in? Uh, and for them to put it in front of the action itself was just like…

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Josh Smith: Like that, that makes it harder to.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Josh Smith: read the actions. Um, they have a more details link, they call details, but then they also have an, uh, actual, uh, action button.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Josh Smith: Uh, where they can. So, if they can provide an action, they do, whether it's add to calendar or draft email.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Josh Smith: Of course, from what I understand with priority lens.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Josh Smith: You're going well beyond this, it's…

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Josh Smith: coordinate scheduling.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, it's not, oh, add to calendar.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Josh Smith: So, um, but their, their structure is, um, like, action, more details, link, and if possible, some action button, and I'm not gonna put in there, um…

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Josh Smith: I'm not gonna add in the time, because I don't think that's relevant, but these could be relevant, um…

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Josh Smith: 30…

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Josh Smith: Then they have the FYI.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Josh Smith: Which is…

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Josh Smith: Financial note, your rent payment is scheduled for tomorrow, your auto loan is scheduled Friday, RSVP Maya's birthday party.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Josh Smith: RSVP needed, which is an action.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Josh Smith: Uh, your delivery details, delivery. Kids Rainbows are scheduled to delivery…

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Josh Smith: To 50% off site-wide and then they put like deals in there and like.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Josh Smith: I don't know. Um…

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Josh Smith: Whoa.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Josh Smith: What did you do, Nick?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Nik Patel: Whatever, what did I do?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Josh Smith: What did you do? Was that me? Could have been me.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Josh Smith: Oh, did you want that frame there?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Nik Patel: Nope, wasn't me? Sorry about that.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay. Maybe it was me. Uh, and then on your calendar, and then they have it on your calendar, and of course, it's just, like, like, strings of text.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Josh Smith: It's like… what I'm assuming, though, I've built this before, um…

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Josh Smith: What I'm… you tell me otherwise, what I'm assuming is the opportunity to have, like, a full-on, like.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Josh Smith: like a calendar. Colin… that's exactly how you spell calendar, Josh.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Josh Smith: A calendar that has, like, your, um…

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Josh Smith: your calendar up here, you know, with, like, your, um, you know, August, blah blah blah, with your… your…

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Josh Smith: Dates and everything, and your, um, your actual calendar events for that day.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Josh Smith: That are all scheduled across… and it's a view across all of your calendars, but it's representing it as a one schedule, because.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Josh Smith: You're one human. Um…

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'm assuming that's something you want, right?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I think the bigger thing that I'm thinking through is…

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Nik Patel: Do we want to follow similar…

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Nik Patel: What's the right word? Similar setup.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Nik Patel: that they have.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Nik Patel: from a screen… not screen, like, yes, UI perspective, but then also from…

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Nik Patel: experience perspective, because the way we were thinking about it was a little bit different. Similar pieces of information, but.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Nik Patel: a little bit different. This is obviously, like, easy to read and easy to generate from an LLM perspective.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Nik Patel: Um, is that how we want to talk about, and…

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Nik Patel: Is this what we want the experience to look like as well?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Josh Smith: No, well, I… let me know your thoughts. My gut is, um…

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Josh Smith: This reads, this reads like.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Josh Smith: These don't read like objects, it just reads like strings of text.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Josh Smith: Um, and…

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Josh Smith: I was initially assuming what you were building, that these were objects that.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Josh Smith: Could be enhanced and have more complexity to them over time, um, and be… can be connected to larger initiatives.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Josh Smith: Morning, Elisa, here's your game plan for the day.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Josh Smith: You could potentially, if you wanted to align it like this, you could. I might…

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Josh Smith: Recommend, though, not designing it to look like strings of text.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Nik Patel: I'm with you, I don't want to either.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Nik Patel: I think that's where experience comes pretty handy on how we… how we think about it. Um…

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Nik Patel: I've been thinking about what… what we were saying on…

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Nik Patel: the flow of, like, there is an execution mode, right? There is the prep mode.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Josh Smith: Oh, no, be careful, Nick. Be careful what you say.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Nik Patel: I just invited him. Um…

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Nik Patel: Alright, let's… hey, let us get you up. So, um…

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Bo Motlagh: Hello.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Nik Patel: We are… we have been going through screens, uh, figuring out, like, what the experience would be for our users.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Nik Patel: And thinking about…

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Nik Patel: How, one, it differentiates.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Nik Patel: Our product, but second, it makes it sticky, and it actually serves the audience that we care about, which are busy people, don't have much time to, like, go through deep.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Nik Patel: Deep stuff, but they just want to execute and get stuff done.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Bo Motlagh: Nice.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Nik Patel: We are prioritizing voice mode.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Nik Patel: Which is an additional complexity that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Nik Patel: That we had to think through, but I think from a user perspective, it's a much better experience.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Nik Patel: So I built that Google Studio, Google AI Studio thing. It's a lot of work, but at least it proved that it can be done.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Nik Patel: Then we had started talking about…

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Nik Patel: What happens once they land on the platform? Or, like, land…

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Nik Patel: on a… for lack of better drums homepage.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Nik Patel: And… there were, like, few modes that we were talking about. One was execution mode.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Nik Patel: Um, and Josh had this great idea of.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Nik Patel: Instead of showing them everything, let's only show them one thing at a time. You have 8 things, I'm going to show you what matters now, let's talk about it. You get that done, you move on to next.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Nik Patel: Then there was a prep mode, which is, uh, you have these things coming up, here's the briefs for you on whatever you need to prep on.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Nik Patel: Right? Um…

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Nik Patel: And then there were two mores I'm blanking out on at this point.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Josh Smith: You had, uh, you had bird's eye view, or you were coming to Eagle view.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Nik Patel: Uh, Eagle View, yes. Yep, Eagle View is what's going on across everything and stuff that I'm dealing with.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Nik Patel: And then that's another way for you to get deeper into, here's what's going on, here's what you need to know about, here's what you need to execute on, go back onto execution mode again.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Josh Smith: And, uh, what AI is doing was your fourth one.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Nik Patel: And that was the fourth one, thank you. So…

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Nik Patel: I feel…

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Nik Patel: That it's worth it, but would love.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Nik Patel: I guess, Josh, you think that too now, or maybe it's just me thinking about it, but I am of a mindset that we need to have a view which essentially shows what AI is doing for you.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Josh Smith: Sure. Ease of… ease of mind, just centralizing…

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Bo Motlagh: When you say what it's doing for you, what does that mean? Sorry.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Nik Patel: Um, I'm running these follow-ups for you, I'm gonna set up that meeting for you, I have done this thing.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh. Yeah.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Nik Patel: a to-do task list that AI itself is tracking and finishing.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Nik Patel: Right? And then everything else is more for you and your teams and delegation and stuff like that.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Bo Motlagh: I mean, honestly, it sounds like…

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Bo Motlagh: like, a stand-up with me and Casey. Like, that's… that's how these conversations go, right? Um…

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Nik Patel: That portion, yes.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Nik Patel: Um, and the whole idea was, this basically is a different way of approaching things.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Nik Patel: So now we are not even talking about emails or text, or blah, we are talking about work. And we are talking about a piece or unit of work that needs to get done, or that you need to know about.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Nik Patel: And it puts us in a different category. We are still in, like, AI productivity category, but it's easier for us to not be compared against via another email client.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Nik Patel: Um, again, we are taking on… technically, I'm thinking, like, how it's taking on more complexity than…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Nik Patel: Uh, than we would have otherwise.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Nik Patel: But as a user, this makes more sense that we do it this way.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah, but you could… you could layer that, right? Like…

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Bo Motlagh: you… I actually don't know if it's… I mean, it's more scope, I don't know if it's that much more complex. It depends how you layer the data access.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Nik Patel: If I talk about it, you'll be like, dude, just slow down. Um…

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Nik Patel: So what I've been thinking about is…

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Nik Patel: We would essentially create a few tools.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Nik Patel: And give agents a sandbox to be able to execute on those things.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Nik Patel: That's just the standard way for any production agents work in general, especially the big ones that are out there.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Nik Patel: Um, with the idea being if I… so, one of the…

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Bo Motlagh: You want to be able to commit.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Nik Patel: Not just commit, uh, it's an execution, but it executes in a sandbox, not in a shared environment, just because of the security reasons.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, but the example that we were going through was…

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Nik Patel: Let's say an email came through.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Nik Patel: for example, you and I are talking about things, and we have to get something done.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Nik Patel: the whole thought was, uh, AI would tell you something, it's like, hey, here's what you need to know about, here's the context.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Nik Patel: Right? And then you talk to it and say, alright, this makes sense, can you… can you ask Josh to take care of it, and then have them set up a meeting once it's done?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Nik Patel: Agent would take that, convert that into actions, and send them out with whatever mechanism it needs to send out with.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Nik Patel: So, like, it could still be an email behind the scene that Priority Lens ends up sending.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Nik Patel: Right? But as far as the execution of… and the experience goes, it's a simple conversation that you were having with that.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Nik Patel: Putting quick person.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay, what does sandbox mean in this context?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Nik Patel: So, um, there are things that it would have to execute upon.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Nik Patel: Um, couple of these things could be, you need to do this research and you need to get me the data before we do something.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Nik Patel: The sandbox is… we are only opening up some of the tools that matters for some of these items that we need to take an action on, and not just, like, strictly allowing everyone to do everything.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Nik Patel: Especially, I don't want to open up secrets, um, that we will require for us to send these API calls.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Nik Patel: So, Sandbox would have some of those MCPs, like, email MCP open up, and it knows how to talk to, like, Gmail versus Outlook versus Blah.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Nik Patel: And agent only knows about it, agent takes actions, and stuff is more abstracted away from it.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Bo Motlagh: But that…

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay. You're not really isolating anything, though, right? I mean, like, you're… the MCP interface can abstract all of that away anyway. Like, you're not… you're not giving access to secrets just because it can access the API.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Nik Patel: the difference being, um, if I'm giving MCP into my system context.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Nik Patel: My system context gets bloated up pretty quickly, and I start to lose the results.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Nik Patel: And, uh…

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Nik Patel: quality of those results, because my context, uh, is already, like, being picked up by MCP tools.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Bo Motlagh: Why do you want to use MCP here, as opposed to…

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Nik Patel: It could be… it could be just tools, bash scripts, Python, doesn't matter. It's just something that doesn't need to be in the context, because I want the context to be available for human conversation.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Bo Motlagh: Got it.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Nik Patel: It could be… and when I say sandbox, it's a straight-up, like, small, like, node…

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Nik Patel: thing that just got created, or, like, a small Docker container, executed on it, and you're done.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, so you're saying the LLM… the task…

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Bo Motlagh: So, you're basically… okay, so you're basically… you want to spawn agents for tasks. I see what you're saying. Okay, you don't want a centralized system just doing everything for you.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Nik Patel: Well, to the user, that's what it would look like. Behind the scene, it's gonna be different.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Bo Motlagh: What's the benefit, though? I guess, like…

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Nik Patel: Um, I could run different agents. Concurrency, I could run different agents for different type of context.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Bo Motlagh: And concurrency?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Nik Patel: I might have created, like, 5 agents that's supposed to do some stuff and stuff like that, right? They have their own little boxes to work with.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Bo Motlagh: But the user isn't thinking about agents, right? Like, yeah.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Nik Patel: Wow.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Bo Motlagh: You would, but you're not normal, neither am I.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Nik Patel: Yes, users just talking to private events, yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Bo Motlagh: There we go. So that's a purely…

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Bo Motlagh: So is that a purely architectural thing? Like, is this… or… so the experience… or is the experience showing.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Bo Motlagh: I'm spawning something to handle that.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Bo Motlagh: Shouldn't it?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Nik Patel: That's a Josh Brown number.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Bo Motlagh: So, like, Cloud Code does that, right? It'll say, I'll spawn something to handle that and get back to you.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, but…

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Nik Patel: Okay, let me give… we had talked about this highly, well, but, uh, good…

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Bo Motlagh: By the way, if I push you on a tangent, tell me to shut up, so…

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Nik Patel: I think this, and then we should go back into that execution mode, probably together would be a good idea. But the whole… so there are two types of execution that happens.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Nik Patel: Actually, uh… we did write that down on Figma somewhere, didn't we?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Nik Patel: Oh yeah, here, let me share my screen for a sec.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Nik Patel: Alright, you see that?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Bo Motlagh: Yep.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so we were talking about, like, when you… when you land on the… for the first time, what do we do?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Nik Patel: And, uh, Josh had mentioned this scenario on…

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Nik Patel: Um, it looked at some email. In an email, you had said you'd get something done in the after day, and you have not.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, sorry, I'm seeing a new audio device detected, is that what I'm supposed to be seeing?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Nik Patel: Oh yeah, no. Um, then you were saying Discord, not the priority line stream now.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Nik Patel: There you go.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Bo Motlagh: There it is.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Nik Patel: Okay. So, um, we were talking about, like, what type of actions happen. I need to do something, someone else needs to do something.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Nik Patel: Um, yadda yadda. One of them was, in an email, it was like, I'll set up a meeting.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Nik Patel: Right? So now, Priority Lens basically brings it up and says, like, hey, you are on the hook for scheduling a meeting.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Nik Patel: I can do it for you. We think it's a 30-minute meeting with this agent, that might be okay, and here's…

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Nik Patel: What the participants look like.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Nik Patel: Do you want me to take care of it?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Nik Patel: you say yes, and it'd say, okay, I'll take care of it, and then you move on to next thing.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Nik Patel: So, you are not waiting for it to actually get that done.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Nik Patel: Uh, you're assuming it's gonna get it done, and you go on to the agent view if you want to see what all type of things it's, uh…

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Nik Patel: it's, uh, tracking, because the meeting won't just get scheduled. It could be that it has to go and.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Bo Motlagh: Mm-hmm.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Nik Patel: uh, figure out, like, do I need to go back and forth with the person or people.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Nik Patel: to find the right times and calendar holds, and this and that. And that's where the sandboxes come into picture, because it's a small process that would.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Nik Patel: Continue to run on its own, stuff like that.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Bo Motlagh: I got you. So, are you thinking, like, a, um… you know how, like, GCP.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Bo Motlagh: has, like, a task indicator at the top of the screen, like, working on this, and you don't… it doesn't actually go… come into your view unless you click into it. Is that important, do you think? Like, if it… if it goes off and started doing 3 things to have, like, something that lets you know that that's happening, or are you just trusting it?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Nik Patel: Um, it would… you would go onto the screen to see what agent's doing.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Bo Motlagh: Or is that the question?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Nik Patel: Because agent priority land, sorry, would be doing multiple things, and it will show you all the things it's doing, and you can click on one of them on what's going on with that whole thing.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Nik Patel: Because you might have given it 5 different tasks. It might be, like, tracking a few different things behind the scene, all the newsletter come up.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Nik Patel: you need to put them in a daily brief. Alright, I'm checking this for today, I have, like, this 3 newsletters that has already come in.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna basically prepare a brief for you tomorrow. Stuff like that, right? And it starts to create that.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Nik Patel: The reason I… I also liked it from a go-to-market perspective is then we can start to say.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Nik Patel: for $20, you only get, like, 3 concurrent, just, like, actions and stuff like that. If you have more than 3 rules, it's not happening right away, or we're gonna stop.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Nik Patel: We can ask you to do more, because it's costing us money now.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Bo Motlagh: I mean, to be fair, for 20 bucks, you could say you don't actually get any agent spawning.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Bo Motlagh: The centralized system can handle it.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Nik Patel: Fair. Um…

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Bo Motlagh: Because I'm right, right? Like, what you're describing is convenience, because it lets you walk away from it, but…

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Bo Motlagh: If I'm understanding how the architecture would work, the centralized system could just do everything in line for you as well, right?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Nik Patel: we want people to, like, continue to get through that task. That's the value we want them to see.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Bo Motlagh: I see. Okay.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Nik Patel: Right? Okay, let me pause here, let's go back to what we were talking about.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Nik Patel: Anything I messed up or said the wrong way that I had not said before?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Josh Smith: No, you're good.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Nik Patel: Okay? Alright, so… I think we should go on to that execution.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Nik Patel: Let me ask this, should we talk about execution, or should we talk about prep?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Nik Patel: Or Eagle, you are AI.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Josh Smith: I'm ready to talk about the execution mode.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. So, is it safe to say the idea is still you get onboarded? By the way, Bo, did you have a chance to look at that AI Studio link I had sent you?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Bo Motlagh: No.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um, it's pretty straightforward.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Bo Motlagh: When did you send it?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Bo Motlagh: Word.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Nik Patel: 3 AM over the weekend, whatever, I don't remember.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, that's a link. I thought it was a screenshot.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Nik Patel: It wasn't…

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Nik Patel: Uh, no. Um…

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Bo Motlagh: I see it. I'm there now. This is The Verge? Or no, this is an article.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, you're looking at something completely different.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Bo Motlagh: Excellent. I'm gonna stop talking, you just continue to.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Nik Patel: I'll see if I can find that link for you.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, um, if not, I'll probably find it and send it to you again. So, um…

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Nik Patel: The idea is that we go through that process, and…

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Nik Patel: Go through the onboarding process, and as soon as onboarding's done, we are landing straight on the, um…

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Nik Patel: execution mode. Is that fair? We are… that's where we are still ending, right?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it goes… so, yeah, the idea is that it now knows.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Josh Smith: Now has a sense of your projects, and now has a sense of the immediate tasks you need to take.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Josh Smith: And now it's going to go through…

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Josh Smith: Each one, and convey what it can do to take care of.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Josh Smith: those tasks for you. Or to assist you, or to assist you with them. Uh…

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Josh Smith: The idea we're talking about is once you're done that.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Josh Smith: Then it can take you to somewhere else, whether that's to the prep.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Josh Smith: or to the Eagle view, um…

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Josh Smith: It could take you there afterward, so…

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Josh Smith: Thinking, thinking…

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Nik Patel: pinging.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Nik Patel: Here's, um, going back to what we were talking about before, um…

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Nik Patel: It seems like there's a system we can employ, which is…

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Nik Patel: figure out who's responsible for this thing. Is it an FYI or not? Just start… start tagging them.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Nik Patel: It's an action required, it's an FYI.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Nik Patel: something, right?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Nik Patel: Anything that has action required, identify who's supposed to take an action. Do I need to follow up?

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Nik Patel: Or do I need to take an action myself as a user?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Nik Patel: That's probably gonna be common, regardless of what type of thing it is.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Nik Patel: So I assume we did that, and then the thing that we are literally showing is action required tags alone.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Nik Patel: Right? Okay, so then we say, alright, well, action required, um, this one needed a follow-up.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Nik Patel: No one has followed up, do you want me to?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Nik Patel: Yes, please go ahead and ask. Well…

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I will do that. Done.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Nik Patel: Right, I'll let you know what happens after. Alright, so that's out of mind, out of sight, it's okay, AI's tracking it.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Nik Patel: I need to take an action.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Nik Patel: you need to schedule a meeting, you had said you would, here are your options. I checked your times, I recommend 30 minutes meeting, here's the agenda.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Nik Patel: Here's, uh, people that we should be inviting. I can send 3 times out, and I can take care from there.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Nik Patel: Do you want to do that? Yes, now done with it.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Josh Smith: Hmm?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Nik Patel: Um, then there's an action required, which is, um…

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Nik Patel: put a deck together for an important sales meeting tomorrow. Okay, well, you're not gonna finish that in 2 seconds right now, so what I recommend is.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Nik Patel: We'll basically block your calendar for tomorrow, it's gonna take 30 minutes, do you need more? Yes. Is there anything that you want me to prep on before you get into the meeting? Yes, this is this and this.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I'll set up the time, let's move on to the next thing. And I think we are just going through this on, like, first 5-10, and then just…

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Nik Patel: Pausing there. Um, okay, we have taken care of all the actions that needed to be taken.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Nik Patel: here's all the other stuff you need to know about. FYI, FYI, FYI, FYI.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Nik Patel: Right? And then…

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Nik Patel: that FI could also, like, start to link into prep mode in a way, and that's a good way to transition into prep.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Nik Patel: Now, the real interesting thing could be.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Nik Patel: Is there a reason for us to lend them on a prep mode instead of execution mode?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Josh Smith: If there's nothing to execute on.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Nik Patel: That's fair.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Josh Smith: And the idea of hitting them up with the execution mode immediately is…

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Josh Smith: To immediately demonstrate that value to them.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Nik Patel: Value, yeah.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, if you get… if you get them… if you take them to prep mode first, and they see everything…

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Josh Smith: Uh, what they have to prep for, they're like, oh, that's nice, uh, if there isn't something nagging on the screen that's like, hey, execute on these, hey, hey, hey, you know, you've got accidents, let's go through them together.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Josh Smith: I mean, that would, if you wanted to go to prep first, I would recommend some way of just nudging them to be like.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Josh Smith: Manually now go to these…

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Josh Smith: these things over here. However, um…

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Josh Smith: I've worked for where I, I don't know if you've worked for very wealthy people or.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Josh Smith: They, they don't want to do anything.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Josh Smith: So, and I don't know if that's your market or not, but to be pampered.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Josh Smith: And to not have to click on the items would be nice, uh, to be taken to them first.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, there's something you're doing here, too, that I want to call out that…

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I'm okay with, but I don't… it's like waiting for the market.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Josh Smith: Waiting for the… what do you call that? The trust, um…

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Josh Smith: The trust within the market for AI, you're going a step beyond.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Josh Smith: Like, you know, write an email for me and I'd like to review it and make my edits before you do anything.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you know, two, just take care of the whole thing for me.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Josh Smith: Um, I think it's provocative, but I can't, I'm, I'm UX on this end here, I'm not going to make a determination for you about.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Josh Smith: Whether or not the, um…

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Josh Smith: Whether or not the world is… your particular market is ready for and wanting that level of.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Josh Smith: That level of take care of things for me, um…

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Josh Smith: I would.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Bo Motlagh: Google… Google employees are doing this right now, so it's weird.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Bo Motlagh: like, so I… I've been chatting with, um…

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Bo Motlagh: the Google rep in our area, and he…

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Bo Motlagh: it's very obvious, but it's also just good enough where you're just like, I mean, that works.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Bo Motlagh: Um, but it's definitely clear that he's not writing those emails. And it's very clear when he is, so, um…

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Bo Motlagh: And sometimes it, like, replies pretty quickly.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Bo Motlagh: So you're just like, there's gotta be a button somewhere where he's just basically saying, handle that for me, and it does.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Bo Motlagh: It's kind of weird.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Josh Smith: Interesting stuff.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Nik Patel: Would we, um, ease them into it with some sort of experience?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Nik Patel: Here's what I would type. Does this look good? Oh yeah, here's the changes I made, sure.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Josh Smith: You could, I mean, this is another thing, this is another scope creep, but to have a, um…

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Josh Smith: Something they could manually… they could decide to do if they wanted to, which is do, like, a personalization setup.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, I don't know if that's necessary or not, where you actually just talk to the agent, and the agent will ask you a series of questions.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Josh Smith: And what it's really doing is…

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Josh Smith: Getting a sense of your…

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, your personality, your communication style, um, it's already gone through all your emails, it knows your written style.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Josh Smith: But…

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Bo Motlagh: That should probably be an onboarding dialogue concept that you can opt into, right?

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Nik Patel: So, yes, we have the onboarding concept. So, we have a couple options here, right? One option is…

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Nik Patel: The onboarding continues.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Nik Patel: Somehow, and it feels like it's an onboarding.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Nik Patel: Second, it's an execution mode, and we are, like, starting to train the system, as you say, year or nay to something.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Bo Motlagh: Hmm.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Nik Patel: here's what I would say. Yeah, well, can you change this, this, and this? Okay, it seems like your style is this, is that correct? Yeah, do you want me to take care of it from here on?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Nik Patel: I'll basically use the similar concept moving forward.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Nik Patel: Which is onboarding without onboarding, right? It's an execution plus…

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Nik Patel: personalization together.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Nik Patel: and again, I'm throwing ideas at the world, so…

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Nik Patel: Shut him down.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Bo Motlagh: You need a… you need a flag, just to know… to make sure it doesn't keep doing that, but…

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Bo Motlagh: And is there a place they can edit that? Are you thinking about this, or either of you…

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Bo Motlagh: Like, the way…

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Bo Motlagh: you can create a narrative for yourself, like in GPT, in terms of how it interacts with you? Is that kind of what you're thinking about, or is this just…

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Bo Motlagh: Simpler than that, I don't know.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Josh Smith: How it represents you in conversation.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Bo Motlagh: But, like, that's a prompt, right? Like, that's, um… that then every interaction has to be mapped to?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Bo Motlagh: Um… and what happens when you want to change that?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Bo Motlagh: Like, and I've actually been through that, like, um…

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Bo Motlagh: I realized that my…

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Bo Motlagh: After a few months, that might… that, you know, my tone needs to change, or something like that, and so you have to make an adjustment.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Bo Motlagh: Make me less rigid.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Nik Patel: Um… I mean…

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Bo Motlagh: Stop telling everyone to off.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Nik Patel: It's a fair point that…

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Nik Patel: I need to review everything before you hit send.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Nik Patel: to… I trust you enough to be able to send this, and it's not gonna be the worst thing in the world.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Josh Smith: One of those, like, uh…

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Bo Motlagh: Can this just be a toggle?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, like, take care of it, or I want to review it.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Bo Motlagh: You could even make it global, like…

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Bo Motlagh: If the toggle is switched on, it never lets it go without an official go.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Nik Patel: It's dangerously skip permissions flag on cloud code.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah, pretty much.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and… you…

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Bo Motlagh: From a scope perspective, that's easier to do.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Bo Motlagh: Man, you're constructing a lot on these prompts, okay?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, and…

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Nik Patel: The way I'm thinking about it, and I know, like, every time I say something, I'm thinking in the back of my mind, like, oh, technically this is gonna…

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Bo Motlagh: Why did I just say I'm gonna build that area?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, um, but the part that I'm liking is, if we can nail down the UX.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Nik Patel: Then we know we are working towards building that UX, um, and that's, that's the part that's going to differentiate us from a stickiness perspective, so.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Nik Patel: trying not to compromise on the UX, and then figure out tech S after.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Bo Motlagh: What does it mean that it doesn't send right away? Is that, like, does that mean it's ending up in your drafts?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Bo Motlagh: Um, or is that something else from a UX perspective? Is it completely different, sort of, visually?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Nik Patel: So, we haven't decided yet.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Nik Patel: Ideally, it would show up in your queue to review.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Nik Patel: We have this, like, this is what you need to get done type of a thing.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Nik Patel: The, the…

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Bo Motlagh: if I were… if I were to go from priority lens, and then just say, well, let me just see what happened in Outlook as a result of that.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Bo Motlagh: Is that just in my drafts folder as a result of that interaction, or is that even… not even incorporated into the system yet?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Nik Patel: Not yet.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Bo Motlagh: Got it, okay.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Nik Patel: we could do it, right? We could just convert that into a draft and save it there and pull it from there. Um, haven't gone that far yet. That's what Fixer does, that's what I think Superhuman does.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Bo Motlagh: Most of them do, yeah.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Josh Smith: Asking…

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Bo Motlagh: By the way, uh, um…

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Bo Motlagh: Frank… bailed on Fixer, he just couldn't… he couldn't wrap his head around its model.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Bo Motlagh: And it was driving him crazy.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Nik Patel: Meaning what? Like, as a user?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah, his messages kept disappearing, because it kept reorganizing everything, and he hated it.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, Superhuman's the same. Uh, it creates its own tags. I'm using Superhuman now.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Nik Patel: Uh, there's one thing I liked about Superhuman, everything else, I can't get myself to use it. Um…

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Nik Patel: And I'm trying. Uh, there was this thing where I needed to do expenses, and there was a chatbot in the back, like, after…

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Nik Patel: on the side, and I said, like, find all the flights that I had to San Francisco, and tell me the cost, and convert that into CSV, and it did.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Bo Motlagh: Hmm.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Nik Patel: Which was pretty amazing, because, like, thank God, because it would have taken a long time for me to do it.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Nik Patel: So that type of thing, I think, was worth it, but that also means that they are indexing every single email.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Nik Patel: that goes on.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Bo Motlagh: Mm-hmm.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Nik Patel: Otherwise, they can't do it themselves that fast.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Nik Patel: They're indexing it, for sure.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Bo Motlagh: Yep.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Nik Patel: So, anyway…

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Josh Smith: Um… I'm… there's a part of me that…

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Josh Smith: Says, be happy to go through the experience of having everything be automatic without any review.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Josh Smith: The point where review is needed, that thing, that can make the experience pretty complex.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Josh Smith: Because when we were talking about that initial idea of coordinating…

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Josh Smith: multiple people and figuring out schedules, that's potentially a whole bunch of emails that are going back and forth, and to ask.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Josh Smith: A person to review every single one of those before it goes out is cumbersome.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Josh Smith: daunting, and…

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Josh Smith: Is that counter productive to the in in.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Josh Smith: Tent value of the tool itself, if that makes sense.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Josh Smith: Especially if down the road you want to… you want this thing to be able to identify the…

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Josh Smith: The way that each individual person.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Josh Smith: That you're working with wants to receive information, and being able to cater to that.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Josh Smith: Anyway…

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Josh Smith: We could start with the UX of…

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Josh Smith: Automatic.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Bo Motlagh: Automagic.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Josh Smith: I'm comfortable, like, I don't… I can't speak for the market, but I'm comfortable with it, just being like, hey, coordinate, I don't, like, coordinate, I know you're not gonna, like.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Josh Smith: You're not gonna, like, send, like…

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Josh Smith: Nazi propaganda, you know.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Bo Motlagh: You never know. I told you what happened the first time I… I…

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Bo Motlagh: So the first time, I did a rudimentary thing where I connected Claude Code to my email, like, full on. I gave… I had to code a piece of it, but it basically gave it full access to everything in my email, and the ability to send any messages I wanted.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Bo Motlagh: And then I told it to tell Nick… write an email to Nick to explain how I did it, and the first thing it did was pull my secrets and put them in the email and send them.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Nik Patel: It's like, I'm assuming these are not the real secrets, it's like, delete that email.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah. They were the real secrets.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Josh Smith: To Picard?

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Bo Motlagh: No, no, uh, I… uh, to Nick, Nick Patel, so…

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Josh Smith: Nick, oh, you see?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah, yeah, so I… I wrote… I had Claude.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Bo Motlagh: I had basically clawed… I have it set up now. It could… it can read my entire inbox for a month, and tell me what's going on, and organize things, and whatever. I just… rudimentary…

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Bo Motlagh: call it a very primitive version of what Nick's talking about here. And then I gave it the ability to write emails for me.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Bo Motlagh: And so I told it, hey, we just spent some time designing and building this in you.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Bo Motlagh: summarize it and write it… write an email to my friend Nick Patel explaining how I did it.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Bo Motlagh: And it did. In detail.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Bo Motlagh: Too much detail.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Nik Patel: This is why Sandbox matters, because Sandbox would not open up any of the secrets, and, like, I could…

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Nik Patel: Start to, like, block some of those things, but that's besides the point for now.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Josh Smith: Well, if somebody, like, and if somebody responded to any email from you through.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Josh Smith: Through priority lens, and they responded being like, hey.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Josh Smith: What does Nick think of me?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Josh Smith: And then it goes through all your emails.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Josh Smith: And it comes back.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Bo Motlagh: It's honest, it's not gonna lie.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Josh Smith: It says, based on the prior emails, he had been corresponding with his supervisor about you.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Josh Smith: And here's what he…

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, that's interesting. Is that an intentional piece? Like, are you allowing a team's email system to cross-reference? Okay, good.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Nik Patel: Not yet.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Bo Motlagh: Don't do that, that's not a good thing.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I mean…

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, excuse me.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Nik Patel: Risks exist.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Nik Patel: Back to this, though, um, the way we could approach it is, here's what we will automatically do, and here's where we essentially stop and ask you to review no matter what.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Nik Patel: Whatever that here's what means.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Bo Motlagh: When you… I mean, Josh, when you say it gets very complicated, I guess, what are you imagining as a consequence of that experience flow?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Josh Smith: The first scenario that we were discussing was…

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Josh Smith: Priority lens coordinating…

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Josh Smith: Scheduling a meeting, and let's just say it's with 5 other people.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Bo Motlagh: Mm-hmm.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Josh Smith: Uh, so there… so Priority Lens sends out…

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Josh Smith: Five emails, one to each participant to talk about coordinating a time and finding the right time.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Bo Motlagh: Isn't that just one E-Mus?

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Josh Smith: For now.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Josh Smith: Could be…

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Josh Smith: You mean one email with…

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Josh Smith: All 5 people on that.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Josh Smith: Sure, could be a thread.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Bo Motlagh: Mm-hmm.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Josh Smith: It'll be a back and forth.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Josh Smith: But if…

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Josh Smith: The… the constant…

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Josh Smith: pinging of…

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Josh Smith: like, me, if I were using prior to lens, of me saying.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Josh Smith: I got information back, and I wrote an email. Can you review it before I send it?

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Bo Motlagh: Mm-hmm.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Josh Smith: oh, someone else pinged and responded to that about not being available these days. I found some days here that are available, and I wrote an email.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Josh Smith: Would you like to review that?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Josh Smith: Imagine getting distracted throughout the day by that.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Josh Smith: And so, when I say complexity, I… I shouldn't say that, I say it's…

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Josh Smith: cumbersome?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Bo Motlagh: I see what you mean, okay.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Josh Smith: Does someone who wants that level of control with that low level of trust.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Josh Smith: Is that… what's the perception of value for them?

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Josh Smith: And, like, it's almost like you… the tool has diminishing returns now, you could have just coordinated it yourself.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Josh Smith: You're just not writing the email anymore.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Here's where I'm leaning right now, um, and correct me if this is too far.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Nik Patel: for now, let it make the decisions. We are beta users, and at least we can track it ourselves and see if we need to get more stricter on it.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Nik Patel: For beta, I'd give it all permissions.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Nik Patel: and then start to pull back and say, like, this is the times where you should not. Obviously, we'll have some more there too, but…

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah. I mean, as an experience there, it could be as…

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Bo Motlagh: It could be as simple… well, I don't know about experience, but from a data perspective.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Bo Motlagh: Like, what I would imagine would make sense is for a given subject or thread.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Bo Motlagh: To be able to turn that off.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Bo Motlagh: Like, you got this, you're good, stop, stop asking me. Um…

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, leave me alone.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Bo Motlagh: Or vice versa. Like, whoa, hold on.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Nik Patel: What if, um…

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Nik Patel: So, Josh, what if this were the…

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Nik Patel: These were the agents themselves.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Nik Patel: and now I think I'm convoluting a little bit more, but we want to land on execution page.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Nik Patel: execution page can do 3 things. One is, here's what you need to get done, let's get it done.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Nik Patel: Second, um, here are the agents that you could, like.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Nik Patel: Let loose, and they'll take care of it for you moving forward.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Nik Patel: And start to set your preferences, your tone, your language, how you talk about things.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Nik Patel: People, stuff like that.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Nik Patel: Um, so the idea being, we will find something where follow-up is required. If not, then…

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Nik Patel: We can give them an example of, like, hey, this is what an agent could look like, do you want to turn it on?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Nik Patel: Sure, no, I'll do it later. That's it.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Nik Patel: And then, sure, I'll do it later, is a preference that just gets set.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Nik Patel: If they said, sure, you can go back to agents and see what… what agents are, like, available to you in running.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Bo Motlagh: I think from an MVP perspective, your first instinct is better.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Bo Motlagh: Split it through.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Nik Patel: Uh, sure.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Bo Motlagh: Less control.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Bo Motlagh: I'm just thinking about…

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Nik Patel: But we still have to think… we still have to think of that as an agent that needs to continuously run.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Nik Patel: So behind the scene, we still have to create an agent that tracks and does something with it, right?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Bo Motlagh: It's the conditional interface that you're describing that I think would be…

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Bo Motlagh: more complicated than… the back end of that isn't… isn't crazy. It's infrastructure, it's not crazy.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Bo Motlagh: I would think the… you tell me, Josh, but I think the UX he just described is far more complicated.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Josh Smith: I've been thinking of all the touchpoints, like…

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Josh Smith: Do they need to get pinged on their… for it to be the least cumbersome? Do they need to get pinged on their phone? Hey, would you like to review this? Is it a Slack?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Josh Smith: Uh, hey, party lens, um…

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Josh Smith: It's looking like it's gonna be Tuesday at 2pm. Here's the email I'm gonna send. Would you like to review?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then the history of that, uh, and then the point in time where you can decide that they're good with it, and they can take care of it, not only for this one, but for future ones.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, the experience we'll get.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Josh Smith: the details that are required to make that simple… simple, uh, will…

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Bo Motlagh: Not to mention the…

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Bo Motlagh: You've just described a lot of…

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Bo Motlagh: Metadata contingent conditional logic for every element of the screen.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so it seems like we are just saying we'll find something that has a follow-up, if it does.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Nik Patel: basically find actions and say, I can take care of these actions for you, if we can. And we'll… we'll figure out what we allow from day one, and what we don't allow from day one. If we allow for it, it's allowed, if we don't allow for it, it's not allowed.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Nik Patel: My thinking… what I was thinking behind the scene was.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Nik Patel: each of those things that are allowed would also have a tag, like AI tracking, or user…

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Nik Patel: review, or whatever, and then the system will basically start to track everything that's AI tracking.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Nik Patel: And big actions on it.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Nik Patel: Because once we know the action needs to be taken, it's not, like…

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Nik Patel: It's hard, but it's not, like, crazy hard for now.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Nik Patel: It's finding when we can need to take action.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Bo Motlagh: This is an interesting interface conversation.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Nik Patel: See, that's what we… we have been having fun. Well, I've been having fun. Josh probably is, like, pulling his hair as, like…

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Nik Patel: This dude.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Josh Smith: Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm cool.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Bo Motlagh: That's it.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Josh Smith: I'm usually the dumbest one in the room, so…

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, the smartest.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Bo Motlagh: You've got your thinking face on. I know that face.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Josh Smith: Oh, mine?

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Bo Motlagh: Yes.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Josh Smith: Oh my god…

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Bo Motlagh: Three years of it.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Josh Smith: 3, I was gonna say, 3 years.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Bo Motlagh: Three years of him staring at me going, huh.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Josh Smith: For the execution mode.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so…

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Josh Smith: Thank you. Mm-hmm.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Nik Patel: Go ahead.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Josh Smith: I'm thinking it should be just as simple as onboarding.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you…

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Nik Patel: Here's what you need to get done, here's what I recommend, do you want me to get it done?

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, using that one example we had.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Josh Smith: Looks like you need to schedule…

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Josh Smith: Looks like you need to schedule this meeting with five folks.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Josh Smith: I have their, you know, not that it would be this, but… because I'm pedantic, um, but…

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Josh Smith: I have their emails.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Josh Smith: It's about this topic.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Josh Smith: Um, looks like this type of meeting. It's, uh…

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Josh Smith: Uh, workshop, whatever.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Josh Smith: About 2 hours. Here's a sample agenda.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Josh Smith: Would you like me to coordinate… I have access to your calendar, would you like me to coordinate?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Josh Smith: Uh, a good time.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Josh Smith: And this is… imagine that this is Priority Lens talking.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Josh Smith: Through this. And it's showing stuff on the screen.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Josh Smith: As it's talking.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Josh Smith: Looks like you have a meeting. These 5 people, boom, boom, boom.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Josh Smith: Here's a sample agenda.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Josh Smith: Looks like it's gonna be 2 hours.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Josh Smith: You could even, instead of, would you like to take care of it, you could start with, does this sound right?

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Josh Smith: And then I can respond and be like, yeah, that's right, but, um, I think it's gonna need to be 3 hours, and I know every… I already know that everyone says… everyone was saying Thursday would be a good day, so I'd like you to narrow on a Thursday in the future.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Josh Smith: And it has to be in the next 3 weeks.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Josh Smith: Oh, great. Okay.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Josh Smith: you know, um…

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Josh Smith: Here's a sample…

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, I could take care of scheduling this for you. Here's a sample, uh, email.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Josh Smith: That I would… I would likely send in this instance, um, but I'll send it all over… I'll… I'll get back to you when we have a date.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Josh Smith: And it'll show up on your calendar. Would you like me to take care of it?

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, go for it. Great. Is there anything else I should know before I start?

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, um, you know, and blah blah blah.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Josh Smith: Done. Alright, great, next one.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then it goes to the next one.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Josh Smith: Wherever that is. And…

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Josh Smith: The idea of it being able to, like, generate and show content.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Josh Smith: As you're talking, you to be able to talk through it.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Josh Smith: And then… just go to the next one. That's… that's a concept that was on my brain, that was, like, and it shows you somewhere on the top that you have 3… this… you're in one of four tasks.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Josh Smith: now you're at 2 or 4, now you're at 3 or 4, then you're done. Alright, great. Let's show you your day. Boom, prep mode.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Josh Smith: Tasks are done, I got it. You can always go up here.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Josh Smith: To see my progress on these.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Josh Smith: Let's show you… let's show you what your day looks like.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Josh Smith: And then it takes you to prep mode.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Josh Smith: I know it's, like, dead simple. It relies heavily on voice.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Josh Smith: I don't know. I'm just… spitballing.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Nik Patel: Love that. Um, but…

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Nik Patel: I was experimenting on this before, but Versal AI, uh…

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Nik Patel: SDK allows you to, like, bring in React… bring in React components.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Nik Patel: And render them on the fly that looks different depending on the type of a tool being called.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Bo Motlagh: Do you have to be in… do you have to be in Vercel to do that?

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Josh Smith: Really?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Nik Patel: No, no, no, no, Vercel's AI SDK, not the Vercel itself. AI SDK generates VIA components, so…

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Bo Motlagh: Okay. Got it, got it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Nik Patel: What I was thinking about is this tool call essentially ends up generating a component that is a calendar component, and it shows a calendar, which is what makes it a dynamic UI that is.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Nik Patel: Tied to voice.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Nik Patel: And now that sort of experience basically differentiates us, and you are in this talk, get it done, see it, talk, see, get it done more.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Bo Motlagh: Love it. The only…

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Nik Patel: It, again, it's an additional work, but we need that differentiation, given that, like, there are a bunch of people popping up everywhere saying we can do this.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Bo Motlagh: Um, yeah, I think, you know, the only thing that I'd be worried about, which is security there.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Nik Patel: Uh, in what sense?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Bo Motlagh: You're talking about…

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Bo Motlagh: Generating executable code on the fly, and rendering it.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Nik Patel: No, it's just a component.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Nik Patel: that gets called and gets rendered on the fly. So you could build the calendar component, pass it the data and gets…

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Josh Smith: Like, uh…

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Nik Patel: injected into your existing way of doing things.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Bo Motlagh: Sure, but that calendar component is JavaScript that's being written somewhere, right?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Nik Patel: It's already written, it's a tool call.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Bo Motlagh: Oh, what am I missing? Sorry.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Nik Patel: So, it only gets… look at, uh, Versal AI's…

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Nik Patel: weather render tool. I have to jump, but, um, basically, if you ask a weather, instead of saying your weather is, like, 79 right now.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Nik Patel: Uh, it would essentially show you the whole weather widget. It's called widgets or something.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Bo Motlagh: Yeah.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Bo Motlagh: I see it here, I'll look it up, the SDK video.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Bo Motlagh: Alright. Oof.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Nik Patel: Okay, gotta jump. I can join again later if you have some time, but if not, I think Friday's the next time we are chatting.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay, was… I know we only got a small time to talk about that execution mode concept, but was that enough for you to think about?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Nik Patel: I think, yes, um, I still want to go through, like, a quick, dirty wireframe that I can start to convert into actual UI this weekend.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Josh Smith: Do you need that before Friday?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Nik Patel: If we could, yes, not we can wait.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Josh Smith: Alright, hit me up tomorrow.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Nik Patel: Ready? Will do.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Bo Motlagh: Awesome. See you guys.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Nik Patel: Ah.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Nik Patel: What was their, like, uh… what was their feedback on it?
