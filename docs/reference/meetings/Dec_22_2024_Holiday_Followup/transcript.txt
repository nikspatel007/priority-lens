00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Nik Patel: Turamanda.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Josh Smith: I think I'm working.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Josh Smith: Oh, hi.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Nik Patel: How you doing?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Josh Smith: Doing alright, just, you know, just sitting by the…

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Nik Patel: Oh, nice!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Josh Smith: Sitting by the fire…

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Nik Patel: Well, in the holiday mode.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah, I'm checked out of… I'm checked out almost, so…

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Nik Patel: Nice, nice. Are you gone for, like, uh, both weeks, or working…

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Nik Patel: Not… not working on other stuff, but…

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Josh Smith: I'll be working Monday, Tuesday, and Friday next week.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Nik Patel: Monday, Tuesday, Friday next week, and how about this week?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Josh Smith: I'll be available… I won't be available Wednesday.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Josh Smith: Or Thursday, but I'll be available Friday.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Josh Smith: And… and tomorrow.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Nik Patel: Nice. Nice. Um…

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Nik Patel: Let's see…

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Nik Patel: Where do we go? Where do we start?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Nik Patel: So, I didn't go as far as I wanted to over the weekend.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Nik Patel: Uh, just some other stuff came up.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Josh Smith: It's all good.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Nik Patel: I have Claude building something right now, just to see if I can see the experience with the GlueStack UI.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Josh Smith: Well.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Nik Patel: I built a front-end design skill that basically enforces… well, not enforces, but guides the typography and.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Nik Patel: font and everything. So, just trying to see how that would come out with.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Nik Patel: trying to mimic what I had done with the Google AI Studio.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Nik Patel: With our colors instead, and uh…

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Nik Patel: We'll see what, uh, what happens.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Last we landed, we have…

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Josh Smith: A concept for execution mode that's…

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Josh Smith: As minimal as possible.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Josh Smith: Um… we have, you know, Prep and Eagle.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Nik Patel: We, yeah, we need prep and eagle, yeah.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Josh Smith: Okay. And of course, we've got…

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Josh Smith: Much more beyond that, like…

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Josh Smith: But… okay.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, so what would you like to discuss, uh, today?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Nik Patel: I think, let me, uh…

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Nik Patel: sort of talk through what I'm thinking on the execution mode first. Oh, recording, I'm assuming you're okay.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yeah, I'm…

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so I'm thinking, um…

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Nik Patel: Let's talk through the…

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Nik Patel: Uh, execution mode for a second.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Nik Patel: And then we can jump onto prep mode, and then go into, uh…

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Nik Patel: Go into the execution mode.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Nik Patel: both of them make sense. The part that's still open in my mind is…

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Nik Patel: How do we, uh… and it doesn't have to be now, just putting this in back of your mind.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Nik Patel: Um, sorry, just a sec. Anki?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Nik Patel: Be back.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Nik Patel: Thank you, bye!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so…

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Nik Patel: Where do I go? Oh, yeah. So, the part that I've been thinking about is…

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Nik Patel: Uh, do we have some sort of, like, a companion mode?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Nik Patel: You know? Um, I don't know one way or the other right now, but just curious about it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Nik Patel: Companion mode is, like, you're working on something together.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Nik Patel: So… we'll figure it out, I guess.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Josh Smith: Working on something together.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Nik Patel: You know how we had talked about the canvas mode?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Nik Patel: Right, where, uh, we could create a canvas and, um…

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Nik Patel: AI's doing something, humans doing something, they're, like, collaborating together.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, that's the only part that I… I was thinking about this weekend, and again, don't know where we go from it, especially on the small screen, but…

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Nik Patel: like I said, just putting this in the back of your mind.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Josh Smith: Alright, and this is for execution mode.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Nik Patel: it doesn't have to be execution, right? Like, you go from whatever three modes into this mode, where you're working together.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Josh Smith: Oh, so use your… use a companion.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Alright, so what… the best way for me to help is by…

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Josh Smith: Having a example.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Nik Patel: And we… I don't know what the answer looks like either, so I can think through it today, and then we could probably chat about it later.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Josh Smith: Like a hybrid.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Nik Patel: But we could go into prep and execution to give this some time.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and, like, to be able to differentiate it clearly from, like, voice.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Josh Smith: So, like, of course, voice, I'm just back and forth telling it what I need, and it processing and doing the work.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Josh Smith: And then… and then, yeah, figuring what are the instances in which companion would be helpful.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Josh Smith: you know…

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Josh Smith: Is it just me dropping files in and typing some stuff while the companion.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Josh Smith: Put some ideas in, and is that… is it suddenly just…

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Josh Smith: GPT, but designed differently, like…

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Josh Smith: So… or is it something entirely different, you know?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Nik Patel: I think it's GPT, I don't know if it's designed different or not, but…

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Nik Patel: The experience, probably, in my mind, is we are sharing the same context, we are working on the same thing.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Nik Patel: looking at same files, I'm working on something, and I'm asking you to do something.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Nik Patel: Stuff like that, you know?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Nik Patel: And we could go back and forth and look at it. It's basically a shared context, in a way.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Nik Patel: We'll… I think it might be easier to do that on a bigger screen.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Nik Patel: The other one that I came across, or came up with, was…

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Nik Patel: What if voice mode is not available? I'm in a silent room, or…

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Nik Patel: you know, working in a library, or it's not something I can loudly talk about.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Nik Patel: Uh, it's a sensitive matter of some kind.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Nik Patel: Um, how do I switch to that?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Nik Patel: Type mode of some kind.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Josh Smith: Yes, that's where… so… let's go over… so…

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Josh Smith: Yes, we would have to…

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Josh Smith: Find a way to trigger type mode.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Josh Smith: And, question for you, do you want type mode only to have transcription.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Josh Smith: Uh, the… of, uh, for instance, like.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Josh Smith: what the… what the AI is saying.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Josh Smith: Do you only want that to be in type mode, or would you like to be in voice mode as well?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Nik Patel: Well, that's what I mean, like, what if the voice mode is just not even…

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Josh Smith: They just even don't even want the voice. So then we'd have to… we'd have to do a… be able to switch between… we'd have to…

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Josh Smith: Find a way for the user to switch between voice… voice mode and platform.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Nik Patel: And text. Yep, yep.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Josh Smith: Um, which is different, you know, of course.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Josh Smith: This has been solved in various ways already.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Josh Smith: It's just, we're defaulting.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Josh Smith: In this instance, this experience, we're defaulting to voice mode first, and then going to type mode.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Josh Smith: the… the opposite in ChatGPT is that you… you're invo… when you go to voice mode, it's secondary, and you close it to leave it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, just, like, what would that look like in the reverse for… for type mode? I… I don't think it should be…

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Josh Smith: I don't… I don't prefer ChatGPT's method where you click it and it puts you in an experience almost like a modal that you can close and leave again.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Josh Smith: It's… it almost feels like a…

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Josh Smith: toggle.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Josh Smith: To me, like, do you transition into typing only, or do you transition into talking?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Josh Smith: It's just a matter of where do you do that on the screen, and then what is the experience when you…

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Josh Smith: toggle it.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Nik Patel: So, um…

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Nik Patel: With the voice mode, ChatGPT has these things where it's, like, everything that's being said or being…

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Nik Patel: told is also being written down in text, right, and you can just switch to now you're back in text mode again.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Nik Patel: Um, that's easy because it's a chat interface, and you're expecting it to be in the chat.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Nik Patel: For us.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Nik Patel: That's not the primary thing.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Nik Patel: For us, the primary thing is work, so our screen asset is very limited, and…

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Nik Patel: Gotta work… probably work through that. What I was thinking, for example, is, uh…

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Nik Patel: Where did you do this? So, when you were doing, like, this task name.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Nik Patel: uh, thingy, right? Where we have this… this color is user, or this color is AI, or whatever, either way.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Nik Patel: We could have just, like, a third icon, which is just a keyboard icon.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Nik Patel: Uh, you click on it, and all of a sudden, it's like a keyboard input text box type of a thing.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Nik Patel: Or something like that. Then the hard part really becomes.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Nik Patel: The menu at the bottom, which is also clickable, could get confusing for someone to, like, click that and.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Nik Patel: All of a sudden, you lose the thing you were doing and whatnot.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Josh Smith: Hmm. Alright.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Josh Smith: I mean, this is ideal for mobile.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Josh Smith: For desktop, you know.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Josh Smith: You can move it up there, but…

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Nik Patel: Right. No, I agree, it's ideal that it's there. I'm just saying, like, if it's switched into the text mode.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Nik Patel: As a text box right above that, that's when it starts to get a bit confusing.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Josh Smith: Okay, give me a moment.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Josh Smith: Of course, ultimately.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Josh Smith: Uh, just give me a second. I just need to do a little bit of design work in order to…

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Josh Smith: demonstrate something.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Nik Patel: Okay?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Josh Smith: Right. I'm gonna just choose some dinky icons.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Josh Smith: Give me a moment.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Josh Smith: I'm not advocating these icons, I just need something for now.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Nik Patel: Yep, yeah, that's fine.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Josh Smith: Imagine…

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Josh Smith: That down here…

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so imagine that this…

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Josh Smith: centered… down here…

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Josh Smith: Maybe it's right there, this is on the side…

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Josh Smith: It's its own thing…

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Josh Smith: And let's take some variants here.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Josh Smith: Give me some different examples of what could happen.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Josh Smith: I don't know if you're, uh…

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Josh Smith: looking where I'm…

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Nik Patel: Yep, I'm looking.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so…

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Josh Smith: Here's one concept, um…

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Josh Smith: And, um, where it's in line.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Josh Smith: Because they already…

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, because they already have seen the words.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Josh Smith: Shade of the words with the icons.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Josh Smith: You could potentially collapse it down and keep it all online.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Josh Smith: Other options, of course, are…

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Josh Smith: And then this, this switches from that to, um…

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Josh Smith: Let's see…

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Josh Smith: to this…

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Josh Smith: you know…

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Josh Smith: Where you can start typing in here.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Josh Smith: That's one option.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Nik Patel: Hmm.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Josh Smith: Um, other options… because it's in line with it, you know, you could do that.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, where it squeezes. You could also, like.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Josh Smith: you lose vertical space, but, um…

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Josh Smith: You could also…

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Josh Smith: You know, put it…

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, either below or above.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Josh Smith: Where it's…

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Josh Smith: In that instance.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Josh Smith: It would, like…

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Josh Smith: It would expand above the, uh…

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Josh Smith: the navigation.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Josh Smith: Or it could expand below.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Josh Smith: Um… if… if you wanted it so that execution, Prep and Eagle.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Josh Smith: You stayed on it.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Josh Smith: Wherever you went.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Josh Smith: Then you could imply that it's…

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Josh Smith: Well…

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, that wherever you went, it was always…

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Josh Smith: It was always present.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Nik Patel: The interesting thing is…

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Nik Patel: it doesn't serve any purpose other than knowing that I'm in a particular mode.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Nik Patel: Which, assuming our screens will look different in different modes.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Nik Patel: I should already know where I am, right?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Nik Patel: So we just need a way for them to switch between the modes somehow.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Nik Patel: the way ChatGPT, and I think, for that matter, others are doing, is the left of that text box is essentially, like, a plus icon that lets you upload, like.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Nik Patel: Images and files and all that stuff on their phone.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Nik Patel: I wonder if the modes even make sense there.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Josh Smith: You mean the ability to switch?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Nik Patel: That one's fine, it's the execution prep in Eagle.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Josh Smith: Oh, you mean putting that here?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Josh Smith: If it makes sense to put it to the left like that.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Josh Smith: Or if it makes sense to just keep it below or keep it above.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Nik Patel: Well, do we even want any of them there, or do we have a different way of getting.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Nik Patel: Or switching that.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Josh Smith: Oh, you mean navigating between these?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Nik Patel: Because once we're in execution mode.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Nik Patel: the only time I care about that thing is when I want to switch.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Josh Smith: Yep. So, oh, so it's persistence has less value, is that what you're saying?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Nik Patel: No, I meant, like, other than when I'm ready to switch the mode, it doesn't actually serve any purpose.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Josh Smith: This, this is the navigation.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that portion. Because the way I think about it is, like.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Nik Patel: This icon can still be up here.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Nik Patel: Right, so switch back to the other mode, and that's just a flip-flop toggle.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Nik Patel: And then, if we don't do that, then we have to go back to that hamburger menu switch, in a way.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Nik Patel: Or, we move that whole thing up.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Nik Patel: Um, like, we have…

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Nik Patel: profile icon, which I don't know if you even cared at that point, but, like, profile notification mode, or something like that.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Josh Smith: So, give me a moment.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Josh Smith: And I don't even know if you want…

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Josh Smith: you know, usually, uh, I don't know what you need up there. Um…

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Josh Smith: It's, um…

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Josh Smith: Usually you have it…

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Josh Smith: Now, up there, I think in one of the… in the… one of the concepts I made… where are you?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Josh Smith: There you are.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Josh Smith: I put profile down at the bottom left.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Josh Smith: And I had a navigation in there, um, which…

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Nik Patel: For desktop, it makes sense. Do we want it for the mobile?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Josh Smith: Mmm, no, because it's not even going to show for mobile. For mobile…

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Josh Smith: Where am I?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Josh Smith: So, if we did mobile, let me just set it to mobile.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Josh Smith: So that's mobile right there.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Josh Smith: It would be almost like, um…

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Josh Smith: You'd have to find a way to access additional navigation items.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Josh Smith: But would your… could your execution prep be at the top instead of the bottom?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it could be.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Josh Smith: In that sense… and right here, I mean, it affords you enough space to be able to… if you collapse the copy.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Josh Smith: You could… you could do this, and still save yourself a lot of space, so…

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Josh Smith: Menu for any additional things, like if you wanted to look at your calendar, or rules, or what have you, and then…

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Josh Smith: Let's do your switching between the three modes this way.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Josh Smith: That would work.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Josh Smith: Of course, if you selected that button and got out of this mode.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Josh Smith: It would just kind of…

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Josh Smith: I know this is chunky looking, but…

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Nik Patel: I think we could… we could follow the similar format here, right? This keyboard basically goes up here.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Nik Patel: And these things get converted into this particular…

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, something like that.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, could do that.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Josh Smith: I would only recommend…

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Josh Smith: Centering it.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Josh Smith: But, yeah.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Josh Smith: However that looks, centering it, and then having the text if you want to switch over again, yeah.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Josh Smith: We do that. Keep it in the same spots…

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Josh Smith: What do you think about that?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Nik Patel: Then…

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Nik Patel: on the iPhones, this…

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Nik Patel: This thing makes it hard for us to have those three things at top, right?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Josh Smith: No, um, well…

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Nik Patel: Something like that, yeah.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Josh Smith: Which is fine, because those spaces are used anyway for utility actions and content, like cellular battery time.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Josh Smith: That stuff's already… that area's already off-limits.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Josh Smith: Unless you've… have you ever seen an app where they use that space?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, but more in the background. So, like…

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Nik Patel: when you go in the background, like, United would keep a small icon on the right-hand side of that bar that shows that you have, like.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Nik Patel: 24 minutes you have to do something, or…

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Nik Patel: Uh, call… it's basically more background actions is when it's being used.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Interesting.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Josh Smith: I'll have to look at it.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, sorry, my…

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Josh Smith: I'm more versed in desktop than mobile.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Yeah, I'll download United, because all the apps I'm looking at right now just utilize the, uh…

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Josh Smith: date cellular battery.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Josh Smith: Oh, Wi-Fi.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Josh Smith: Interesting.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Josh Smith: What version of iPhone do you have?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Nik Patel: Uh, now I have 17 Pro Max, but I think it works for anything that has that bar.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Josh Smith: Look at you, Mr. Fancy.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Josh Smith: I'll be right back.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Nik Patel: Um, yeah, it… we had to pick someone, get it, and I got it, but I'm still looking for the fold next year.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Josh Smith: Hi.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: Okay? So, um, we have that concept for…

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Josh Smith: mobile, we could replicate that for desktop, where formerly I had that.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Josh Smith: Navigation at the bottom, just move that navigation up at the top.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Nik Patel: Seems like, yeah, we can do that for now.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Nik Patel: Maybe it needs two hands to get to it, but that's fine. That's probably not the end of the world.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Josh Smith: Not at all.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Josh Smith: Not at all.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so we covered that, um…

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Nik Patel: What else? So…

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Nik Patel: Now, I guess, prep mode?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Nik Patel: We have got 20 minutes, um…

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, let's go to quick prep mode.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Nik Patel: Are you around tomorrow?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yeah, I'm around tomorrow.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Nik Patel: Okay. I could probably do, like.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Nik Patel: 5PM-ish? Well, I don't even know what my schedule looks like tomorrow.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, just, uh, just text me.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Nik Patel: Uh, okay, I will.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Josh Smith: Um, so prep mode, let's… before we design anything, let's talk about…

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Josh Smith: Content for prep mode.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Josh Smith: So, let's move over, um…

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Josh Smith: Just because it's a tad easier.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Nik Patel: Alright.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Josh Smith: Uh, let's…

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Josh Smith: move.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Josh Smith: Over here…

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Josh Smith: Rep mode…

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Josh Smith: Go…

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Josh Smith: Hard to get in? Do you have to, like, sign in or something?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Nik Patel: do what? I… I can't do, uh…

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Nik Patel: Where did you go?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I sent a link in chat.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Nik Patel: Oh.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Nik Patel: I can only view, there is no added access, but beyond that, I think it's okay.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Josh Smith: You should have it. I opened a session.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Nik Patel: Okay, no, I have it here, not on the Figma… the board thing.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Um, let's talk about prep mode. What… what kind of objects would you see?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Josh Smith: on that page, like, for instance, um…

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you know, um…

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Josh Smith: Your, you know, is it, uh… today's events?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Josh Smith: You know, is that an object where it's like a, you know, like, um, a view of…

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Josh Smith: you know, uh…

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Josh Smith: You know, in aggregate.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Josh Smith: Of all your calendar events?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Josh Smith: Uh, that are occurring that day?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm. That's another thing, is like, do we need a simpler way for them to actually go back to the calendar mode and.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Nik Patel: email mode or whatever. I don't know if it matters right now, but just FYI. So, it can be calendar.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Nik Patel: It can be a task.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so it's an aggregate of events and tasks.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Nik Patel: Pretty much, yeah. Um…

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Nik Patel: I think…

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Nik Patel: I think so, yeah.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so it's an aggregate of all your calendar events or tasks that are occurring or due that day.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, you say maybe it's, like, sorted.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Josh Smith: chronologically?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Nik Patel: Chronologically, and what's the most urgent or new the soonest?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Josh Smith: Okay? Great.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Josh Smith: Alright, what other ideas do we have for this page, or is that it?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Nik Patel: Um, that just shows the list view, and then once we have the list view, we can figure out, um…

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Nik Patel: like, what to actually show to prep.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Nik Patel: By the way, off topic, but…

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Nik Patel: If I click on…

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Nik Patel: Trying to do something with this thing.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Nik Patel: So, assume this is the app, right?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Nik Patel: I tap on it, it basically does something.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Nik Patel: And then users picks, and it does something.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, what do you think of this X- I don't like the orb on the right outer side. Color-wise, what do I need to improve?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Josh Smith: Color-wise, I'd, uh… I would not start with color, I'd just start with, uh, interaction. Um…

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Josh Smith: I'd want to play with it. Color… but tonality's… the tonality just looks fine as it is right there. It's dark mode, though.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Nik Patel: There is no mode. This is the colors we are going with.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Nik Patel: So, we'll figure it out. I had Claude just build something for me, just so I could see how much space do I have on the actual screen to be able to play with it, and it does feel like there is, like, decent enough.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Nik Patel: space, right? Um…

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Nik Patel: I mean, I have a Pro Max, I have a much bigger screen than normal, but at least on the bigger screen, it's a good enough space.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, it looks fine.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Josh Smith: It looks fun, and the… the… yeah.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Nik Patel: Alright, I'll continue to work through it, and it's just, you know, just wanted to see what this looks like.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Would you do that right now?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, while I was chatting with you, it was working in the background.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Josh Smith: Interesting.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Josh Smith: Do you want to design out this one thing, today's events and tasks, in aggregate, and then, like, the list view, and then the detail view? Is that what… is it for prep?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Nik Patel: I think so, um…

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Nik Patel: Right, when I think about prep, I generally am thinking about it in three different contexts. I think one thing we're missing.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Nik Patel: It's just the people first, but that's something to worry about later. Alright, when I'm thinking about prep, I'm thinking about I need to get something done.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Nik Patel: What does it mean? I need to do something for an event, meeting, or whatnot. What do I do?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Nik Patel: And then I need to know about the person, like, I'm meeting someone for dinner, or we are going somewhere, how do I, like, be prepped to make sure that I…

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Nik Patel: I'm looking like a person in front of that person. So it's generally those type of things that come up.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Nik Patel: if it's a task, it's more outcome-based, right? So, like, I need to get this done, what do I need to know?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Nik Patel: What needs to happen, um, let's make it happen.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, if it's a meeting, who's invited, where is the meeting.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Nik Patel: when do I need to leave if it's somewhere else?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Nik Patel: What's the background on it, if there is an agent, uh…

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Nik Patel: Actually, agent doing the work and telling me, like, based on this needs to be discussed, here's what you need to know.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Nik Patel: And then something.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Nik Patel: And then, uh, people that are involved.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Nik Patel: What does it mean? What is the role of those people, or what they have been doing, stuff like that. That's what I would think about from a meeting perspective.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Nik Patel: And then if I'm walking into a meeting where it's more, like.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Nik Patel: Actually, this would be pretty cool. I have not seen anyone do this.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Nik Patel: when I'm walking into a meeting.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Nik Patel: Generally, there are two modes. One is…

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Nik Patel: Let's collectively get work done.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Nik Patel: Right? Um…

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Nik Patel: And it's important to know about the work that needs to be done, or…

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Nik Patel: Uh, a task that needs to be achieved or outcome that we want.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Nik Patel: It's equally as important to understand the people that are involved in that meeting.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Nik Patel: And they're…

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Nik Patel: How do I work with them in a way to achieve the goal that we want to achieve? None of the meeting preps.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Nik Patel: out there actually do that. They never focus on people. They only focus on tasks. I think if you start to focus on people equally.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Nik Patel: That would put us in a much better spot.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Josh Smith: That's a, uh…

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Josh Smith: That is a path… that is a path of conversation.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Josh Smith: But what I'm hearing from you, you're kind of building, like, a bit of, like, a mind map as we're talking, and I should have been…

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Josh Smith: Recording as you were chatting, but um…

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Nik Patel: We are recording.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Josh Smith: Well, good. Oh, good. We are recording, so you can get this out.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Josh Smith: Because you were saying, like, um…

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Josh Smith: Um, logic prep mode, and then, um…

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Josh Smith: Meeting…

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Josh Smith: Task… um…

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Josh Smith: Meeting, task, movie event…

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Josh Smith: Meeting, uh, you know, people…

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Josh Smith: No, uh…

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Josh Smith: positions, um…

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, the roles, uh, the roles are responsibilities.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Josh Smith: I should put those on separate sections. Roles…

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Josh Smith: responsibilities…

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Josh Smith: Um, even down to, um…

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Josh Smith: Intents and interests…

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, um…

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Josh Smith: Communication styles…

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Josh Smith: Um… meeting also is, like…

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Josh Smith: The agenda…

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Josh Smith: Uh, the goal or purpose…

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, the location…

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Josh Smith: Um, of course, you know, date.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Josh Smith: time, all those things.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Josh Smith: task, you know, like…

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Josh Smith: you know, um…

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Josh Smith: Person responsible.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Josh Smith: event, you know…

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Josh Smith: Pause dates, time…

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Josh Smith: Dress code…

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Josh Smith: You know, so, like, um, the idea of, like.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Josh Smith: Being able to define, like, what's the most important… what are the most important pieces of information.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Josh Smith: What are the types?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Josh Smith: Uh, we have meeting task, I just said event, because if it's, like, it's not a meeting, but you're going to dinner. You mentioned, like.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Josh Smith: Going out to dinner.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Josh Smith: Date, time, location, dress code, uh, you know, transportation…

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Nik Patel: Same for meeting to… meeting as transportation.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Josh Smith: Transportation…

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Nik Patel: optional.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Josh Smith: You know, and, you know, event, if it's a dinner.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Josh Smith: You know, or, uh, you know, there's still, like, a goal purpose if, you know, if you're going, um…

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Josh Smith: golfing.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Josh Smith: Um… what do we know about these people? What's your… what's…

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Josh Smith: What's your agenda for that meeting?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Josh Smith: What do you need to know, you know, dress this way, here's your etiquette.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Josh Smith: You know, avoid these kinds of conversations. This dude, really, to talk about.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Josh Smith: Phishing, and asking questions, you know.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Nik Patel: And we had, like, in the original one, we had, like, this calendar, people, outcome type of.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Nik Patel: menus. I wonder if those menus probably still have value, just a different way of slicing something.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Nik Patel: Because those are more directory…

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Nik Patel: standard experience type of stuff.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Nik Patel: This is priority lens experience, in a way.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Josh Smith: But if you can land on, like, these are definitely the ones, then I can take those as objects and we can design against them.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I…

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Josh Smith: Even, like, recommendations, things that are more freeform from…

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Josh Smith: Or may I? Sorry.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. And I…

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Nik Patel: when I think about…

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Nik Patel: the prep, right? It's…

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Nik Patel: What, why, how, who.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Nik Patel: Everything else probably fits in one of those four.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Nik Patel: So, what is this about?

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Nik Patel: Why does this matter?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Nik Patel: How are we doing this, or how do we get where we need to get to, whatever that might be.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Nik Patel: Uh, what…

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Nik Patel: the mechanisms of it, which is what I need to know, and then, uh, people, which is who.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Nik Patel: And then different type of prep may have different type of…

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Nik Patel: Showcasing this, but it's between those four.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Nik Patel: Unless I'm… unless I'm missing something.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Nik Patel: And go, what, why, how, what, why, who, how.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Nik Patel: Just from, like, a…

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Josh Smith: I am.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Nik Patel: I like your perspective.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Josh Smith: And so, from a design… from…

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Josh Smith: From the design side, you could potentially group.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Josh Smith: the objects…

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Josh Smith: The pieces of data into those four buckets.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Nik Patel: Into those for Markets app.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Josh Smith: And so, in the… in the details view, so…

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Josh Smith: Prep is gonna have a list view, and then maybe it'll default to the next one.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Josh Smith: And it'll show the past ones for the day. It'll default to the one that's right and upcoming, or the one that you're in the middle of.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Josh Smith: So if there… if there's one that's… that you're right in the middle of, yeah, it'll default. If there isn't one you're in the middle of, but there's one next, it'll default to that one, and it'll open that one in the details view, right to the right of it.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Josh Smith: And it'll have…

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Josh Smith: this stuff. Uh…

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, different type of information at different times, basically.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Um…

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Josh Smith: And I'm assuming that, um…

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, under how, maybe, under the mechanisms, there's recommended actions…

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Josh Smith: You could… you could add… you could, um…

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Josh Smith: You could throw in documents and add documents if you want. You could associate that to a… you could associate that particular meeting to a bigger project.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Nik Patel: And also, um, I think what would be cool is… so how is essentially what you need to know?

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Nik Patel: Right? And then person can figure out whatever they want to do with it. What would be cool is, as I'm prepping for it, I could give AI some task and say, like, alright, well, it's coming up in 2 hours.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Nik Patel: can you go figure this, this, this, and this out for me? And then it essentially creates a section for, like, whatever you had asked.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Nik Patel: it's like a built-in task that we give to AIE, I just finished it, it's transactional.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Nik Patel: But that's much better, if you could do that, because then prep is done not just as, like, information download to us.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Nik Patel: But then, we have given something that we did not have time for. Indeed, the work in this context came back, and we are good.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Josh Smith: Oh, kind of like, um…

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Josh Smith: You know, recommend…

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Josh Smith: Recommend menu items for me. Um…

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Josh Smith: recommend a wine, if it's, like, a dinner. Recommend… what wine should I recommend for this type of person? Give me 3 options.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Josh Smith: So, I sent out an email to them, telling them I'll be there, because I haven't done that yet. RSVP, positive, uh, say yes. Um, take a look at the trans… take a look at.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Josh Smith: patterns for traffic in the evenings, and let me know exactly what time I need to leave.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Josh Smith: Uh… hail an Uber for me.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Josh Smith: Um, at that time. Uh…

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, so that I can walk out and be… and be right there for me.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Nik Patel: Yep, exactly, and just going off of that same dinner type of thing.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Nik Patel: Or let's say I was coming into this meeting with you.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Nik Patel: I'm going… starting with dinner, though, is, alright, I'm going into this dinner. Last time I had talked with John about.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Nik Patel: his new startup. Uh, can you check if there were any updates on his LinkedIn on the startup?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Josh Smith: Mmm, oh, okay. Give me a profile on the folks, the most recent information on these folks.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Nik Patel: Right?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, if we could figure that out. The other one, that is more, like, event-based, outside of our system, whatnot, internet search.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Nik Patel: On the meetings, let's say you and I were having a meeting.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Nik Patel: Well, Nick, you had said you would get the app ready, you have not, um, but you did research about XYZ things. Is any of these things worth bringing up?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Nik Patel: oh yeah, this one's good to bring up. Can you find out some, uh, some examples of it that I can bring up so I'm prepared?

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Nik Patel: Right? It's more… that's actually a chat mechanism, but it's very contextual chat mechanism.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Nik Patel: It would do the work, and it would go away, it would do the work, go away, type of thing.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Nik Patel: At least one, technically.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Josh Smith: Or yeah, figure out… figure out when Nik lives, check out the latest news articles from that area. Let me know if there's anything of interest.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Josh Smith: To bring up.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Josh Smith: Or… okay, I see. Or, if I know that Nick is working in this industry, in this space.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Josh Smith: Send me some hot topic that's happening in that space right now.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, exactly. Uh, and it really depends on type of the event, type of the meeting, what you're doing, how you're gonna do about it, or go about doing it.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Nik Patel: Um, but what I like is, let's say if we are preparing early, I might give some tasks to AI to do.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Nik Patel: Right? And before we actually go into the meeting, AI could come back and say, like, hey, the meeting's coming up, I have done the work for you.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah. And then there's stuff that I would maybe want a reminder for, like, oh gosh.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Josh Smith: AI can't pick up my dry cleaning, but it's right down the street. Just a reminder to ping me about that.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Josh Smith: Okay. So, each detail section will have a back-and-forth kind of…

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Josh Smith: Either text-based or voice-based.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Josh Smith: And while we're doing that, it will…

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Josh Smith: Detail out what the re… what the…

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Josh Smith: The outcomes were from that conversation.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so that should occupy the bulk of the experience.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Josh Smith: All the other details should be there, like, nice to know, but…

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Nik Patel: Right.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Josh Smith: It should probably…

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Josh Smith: This is designed to focus on.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Josh Smith: Let's get you ready for this event. Let's get you ready for…

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Nik Patel: Exactly. Um, okay, I had to drop in a second, but hopefully this helps on, like, what do we do for prep, and I'll do some thinking on the eagle mode tomorrow.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Nik Patel: Let me show you what the new version of this looks like.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Nik Patel: So this is what the new version is.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Nik Patel: The colors are a bit more…

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Nik Patel: The orb looks a little bit better, um…

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Did you just make that again while we were chatting?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Nik Patel: Yep, um…

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Josh Smith: Yes, it… it has a higher fidelity.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Nik Patel: Sorry.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Um, I'm also used to multitasking, um…

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Josh Smith: 4.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Nik Patel: So anyway, um, I'll actually get this hooked up and wired up and everything, so we can see full experience in action.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Nik Patel: Uh, may not happen tomorrow, but this week for sure.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Nik Patel: I… I think if we… if you have some time on this, and if you want to, like, go ahead and start drawing something.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Nik Patel: or putting some sort of a screen around, that's great. If not, we can talk about that tomorrow.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Josh Smith: I have some ideas already in my head on how this would be laid out, so…

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Nik Patel: Okay, awesome. Um, so I think that happens, then execution happens.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Nik Patel: Um, so those 3 modes are good, and then we are essentially figuring out.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Nik Patel: where does AI tracking goes, where does your to-do, calendar people, stuff like that. Um, once we, like, align them in a way.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Nik Patel: that's probably MP ready.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Nik Patel: Getting closer.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Josh Smith: Hi.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Nik Patel: I'm sorry, I clicked on the wrong button, uh…

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Josh Smith: How are you feeling?

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Nik Patel: Pretty good, I'm actually pretty excited about how this is coming along.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Nik Patel: It feels like it's giving the experience that feels natural, yet different.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Nik Patel: I will see when we actually start using it if it's too different, but it doesn't feel like someone has a learning curve here, which was the important thing.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Josh Smith: Good, good. And they're not thrown… lobbed at with tons of information and stuff they don't know what to do with, so…

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Nik Patel: Yep, exactly. So, no, I'm pretty excited about this, for sure.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Josh Smith: Right.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Josh Smith: Great. Enjoy your day, man.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Nik Patel: Alrighty, thank you, have a good one.
