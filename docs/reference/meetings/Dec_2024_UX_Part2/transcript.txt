00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Nik Patel: Hey there.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Josh Smith: How was your day so far?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Nik Patel: Good. Uh, been back-to-back in meetings, but, uh.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Nik Patel: That was expected after… after today.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Josh Smith: How many contracts are you working on right now?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Nik Patel: Uh, 2…

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Nik Patel: But, uh…

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Nik Patel: there are some more stuff that I needed to knock out, and that just turned out to be more meetings, so…

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Josh Smith: Alright, you and I are in a similar place.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, how many you have going on?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Josh Smith: I have a full-time job and 3 contracts.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Nik Patel: Oh, wow, alright, that's a lot.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I don't know what my problem is.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Nik Patel: Same here. Um…

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Nik Patel: I'd, uh, we are… we are working on, uh…

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Nik Patel: Starting, like, a franchise business, more brick and mortar type.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Nik Patel: So that, lucky enough, uh, Anki.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nik Patel: Anki can take care of a lot of it, but there is still, like.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Nik Patel: Oh, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, that comes up. Um…

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Nik Patel: And yeah, the list adds up, and she's like.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Nik Patel: Dude, you gotta slow down. It's like, nah, it's time to push.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and um…

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Josh Smith: I don't know if this is you, but for me, um…

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Josh Smith: as long as I've got healthy relationships and, like, there's no, like, toxic environments or people.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Josh Smith: it's… harder for me to recognize burnout with the work itself, because I'm like, work is eas… like, the work is easy. People…

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, people are good.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Josh Smith: People are what stress me out, yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, same here.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Nik Patel: I don't know who said this, but this has been, like, making rounds multiple times on Burnout itself.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Nik Patel: One thing that has stuck with me is…

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Nik Patel: When work feels like we are actually winning.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Nik Patel: Hard work doesn't lead to burnout, it's more like…

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Nik Patel: you're passionate and you would push and stuff like that. Obviously, you gotta take care of health and family relations and all that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Nik Patel: But it's not a burnout. But when it feels like…

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Nik Patel: It's a… it's a bureaucracy, things are not going well.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Nik Patel: You are just spinning wheels, your work's not appreciated, all of that things.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Nik Patel: I think that's what ends up leading to burnout. It's like, you know what, I just don't want this anymore, type of a thing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Nik Patel: And it's… this year has been exactly that. Been pushing so hard.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Nik Patel: And yet, I'm, like, ever-energized, and it's like, oh, this is the time, I'm having fun, let's do it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, last year…

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Nik Patel: This is 25. So last year.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Nik Patel: was other way around. My startup.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Nik Patel: Co-founder, um, and her approaches were…

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Nik Patel: A little bit different than what I would do in a business.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Nik Patel: And it just felt… and we… we just were not…

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Nik Patel: Going in the right direction as a company.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Nik Patel: Sales were not coming up, growth was stagnating.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Nik Patel: I had done, like, 3 layoffs in a year and a half.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Nik Patel: My team went from, like, 80 engineers to 12.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Nik Patel: which, like…

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Nik Patel: Going to engineers as a leader in front of them and saying, like.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Nik Patel: Hey, you did a great job, but sorry, and then doing that, like, every 6 months just continues to add up, you know?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Nik Patel: So, anyway, a lot of that led to burnout, but…

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Nik Patel: it wasn't because I was working hard.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Nik Patel: I'm still working out now, and it feels fun.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, that makes… it makes complete sense, I get it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Josh Smith: I get it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Nik Patel: Awesome. Alright, do you mind if I record the call?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, all good. I do not… I do not mind.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Yep.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Josh Smith: I do not mind. I hate… sometimes English, man.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, uh, it's…

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Nik Patel: My clients are California, and one of them is, like.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Nik Patel: hide…

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Nik Patel: highly regulated industry, so they are, like, so big on CCPA and.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Nik Patel: all the California privacy stuff, so…

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Nik Patel: we can't even record a call without senior director approval, record a meeting without senior director approval. It does not matter what the meeting is.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Nik Patel: And there is another one where…

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Nik Patel: when you are done with the meeting, all the copilot notes go away. So you have to get the co-pilot notes.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Nik Patel: Before you drop the meeting, otherwise you can't get anything, because all the transcripts can be let you.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Nik Patel: And, um, so, like, I've gotten this habit of, like, just ask, and, you know.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Nik Patel: For the most part, no one says no, but it's at least…

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Nik Patel: Hey, it wasn't a surprise to you.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Nik Patel: we had this thing happen where I did a workshop on GenAI for 4 hours.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Nik Patel: And at the end, people were, uh… the director was like, I know we recorded the call, but we should have let everyone know that we are going to record it, and now I have to go back and…

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Nik Patel: ask everyone, and if they don't want it, I have to, like, cut out their voice, and everything is like, oh, wow.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Nik Patel: So, yeah, it's a different world in that…

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Nik Patel: That side, so…

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Josh Smith: Oh, wow.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Nik Patel: You wouldn't think that's a thing, but apparently it is.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Josh Smith: Oh, man, that's funny.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Josh Smith: Ah, oh well.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Josh Smith: It's like, man, sometimes it's like, alright, well…

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Josh Smith: All that work, then…

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Josh Smith: Let's not even…

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, let's not even worry about it, yeah.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Um, yeah, some people… I mean, I have a contract where it's like a…

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Josh Smith: The owner's a billionaire, and he's never done a startup before, he's only done enterprise, and he's trying the startup idea.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Josh Smith: And it's a little bit soul-sucking, this contract. I do it for the money, but I'm like, I don't know how much longer I can survive.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Josh Smith: Uh, because…

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Josh Smith: they… with… they're high security, as if they were, like, a financial firm, but it's like a B2C, like… like…

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Josh Smith: Survey app or something.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Nik Patel: A smaller thing. Oh.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, but they're, like, they're like, we gotta… we gotta spend a whole bunch of time making sure this supports CCPA.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Nik Patel: To severe? Yep.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Josh Smith: And I'm like, y'all, you know there's, like, thresholds.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Josh Smith: That you are not gonna meet for, like.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Josh Smith: Many, many years.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Josh Smith: But they're like, no, no, but we're gonna…

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Josh Smith: we're gonna build a huge infrastructure to support this now. And I'm like.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Nik Patel: There it is.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Nik Patel: Yep, yep, uh, I think the requirement for…

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Nik Patel: at least the CCPA compliance is about 50,000 active users, monthly active users or something, and it's like, yeah, that's a big enough startup, like.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Nik Patel: And that has to be, like, 50,000 in California, if I remember it right.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah. In the state of California, yeah.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, yep.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Nik Patel: Yes, exactly.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Josh Smith: So it's like, yo, we don't need to worry about that now.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Josh Smith: Um, alright.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let's, uh… yeah, let's jump in. Um…

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let's get some, uh, let's get some, uh, definition to this, um…

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Josh Smith: this idea. So I'm gonna…

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Josh Smith: Over…

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'll give you a share, I'll send you the share link again to where I'm playing.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, I think it's the same one, right?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Josh Smith: Yep, I'm…

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Nik Patel: Same, yep. I'm in there.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Josh Smith: Same one, um…

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Josh Smith: Okay, and I'll put in any details, uh, we'll detail this out, so…

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so we first have the…

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Josh Smith: the Gmail…

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Josh Smith: Gmail button… there we go.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Josh Smith: So this is your, like, um…

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Josh Smith: Sing. Um…

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Josh Smith: Sign in with Google, they usually have, like.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Josh Smith: There are button styles you can use.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Yep.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Josh Smith: Sign in with Google, and you're probably gonna have, um…

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Josh Smith: You know, you're…

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Josh Smith: Priority lens, you're, uh…

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Josh Smith: You know, whatever details you want up here for copy.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Josh Smith: Um… are you… sorry, you are calling it Priority Lens?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Nik Patel: The product itself is Priority Lens.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Nik Patel: For what it's worth, I…

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Nik Patel: We haven't landed on this, but…

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Nik Patel: I'm going back and forth, so the company itself will remain priority lands.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Nik Patel: I'm going back and forth if we just call the product same as assistant name.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Nik Patel: Or do we keep the product and assistant as two separate things?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Nik Patel: on one side, I'm… I like the idea of having the assistant name being the product name.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Nik Patel: But it's gonna be really hard to find an assistant name that doesn't have .AI already taken up.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Nik Patel: something equivalent.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Nik Patel: So, yeah, for now, just call it Priority Lens, um, or just pick a name, Lens, or Lance, or something, and we'll just…

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Nik Patel: Change it whenever.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Josh Smith: Let me just give… let me just think a bit, um…

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Josh Smith: Up to you, right? Uh, it's like, that's like a six, one, half dozen, the other.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and you're right, though, that, like, if… if you name your product… I'm just using… I'll just use Cortex, even though that's probably…

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Josh Smith: if you name your product Cortex AI.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Josh Smith: That sounds like a name, so you could say, hi, I'm Cortex.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Nik Patel: Right.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Josh Smith: If you name your product Priority Lens.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Josh Smith: you probably want to choose, hi, I'm…

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Josh Smith: lens, or I'm, you know, Lance, or whatever. Something that's…

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Nik Patel: Right. More human.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, rather than my name is Priority Lens.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so you got priority lines, tagline, sign in, I'm going to just, um, use this…

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Josh Smith: Uh, one right here, just to represent, um…

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Josh Smith: a, uh… the Google, um…

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Josh Smith: the Google Modal.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Josh Smith: That you have to do the whole allow, disallow, allow…

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Josh Smith: Or not. Experience.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Josh Smith: You know…

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Josh Smith: I'm not gonna get too details with… too detailed with this, because we're…

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Josh Smith: This is the easy stuff. You want to get into the…

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Josh Smith: Main stuff.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Josh Smith: Next hole…

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Josh Smith: Google once.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Josh Smith: access.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Josh Smith: So that's your Google Once Access page.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Josh Smith: Alright, next page is, um…

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Josh Smith: Next page is your, um…

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Josh Smith: uh, two-factor…

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Josh Smith: Two-factor…

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Josh Smith: You came into Frontline through Chicago's Appletrac, right?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Nik Patel: Uh… I think it was Frontline when I joined it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Nik Patel: Uh, I was part of Aplitrack team back then, but I think it was already Frontline when I joined.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Nik Patel: Yep, I joined 20…

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Nik Patel: 16?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Nik Patel: I think? So, yeah.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Josh Smith: I was 2014 to 2019… 2014 to 2019? 2014 to 2019, yeah.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Nik Patel: Got it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Nik Patel: Did you end up investing, uh, after Thoma Bravo?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Josh Smith: I got ears from Tomo Bravo.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Josh Smith: I did not end up investing post-Thomo Bravo, though.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Josh Smith: So… did you?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Nik Patel: Nope. I was planning on doing that, but it's like, I'll just use that money for something else. It wasn't, like, too much anyway.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yeah, it's, it's like…

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Josh Smith: Tell him a bravo, man.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Nik Patel: They ended up selling again, I think, recently, didn't they?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Josh Smith: They sold to Roper Technologies.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Josh Smith: I was like, alright, dude, alright.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Josh Smith: Alright, y'all.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, they had their exit already.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Nik Patel: Yep. I think it was a good one, too, from what I heard, at least financially.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, they got their money back.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Nik Patel: Yep. More.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Josh Smith: and more. Now Roper's on the hook to figure out how to…

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Nik Patel: How do you make more out of that more?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Josh Smith: How to make more, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Josh Smith: Um… and, like.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Josh Smith: They're going through rifts like crazy, like, um…

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, they went through a rift, like, last week, or the week before, a whole bunch of people got sacked.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Nik Patel: What they have.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Josh Smith: I've got people from Frontline texting me, saying, hey, I'm trying to get out.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Josh Smith: Like, okay.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Josh Smith: Alright, there we go.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Josh Smith: I'm not gonna spend too much time on this.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it's all good. I think this one I can… or this type of things I can quickly knock out.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Nik Patel: And a lot of this might actually be part of.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Nik Patel: one of the auth providers that I end up picking, they might have all of this, like, available to them.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Nik Patel: On their side, too, so…

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Once you're in, then now let's talk about the… the meat.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'm gonna bring up, uh, what we discussed earlier today.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Josh Smith: Junk.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Josh Smith: Now, before we get into this, we're gonna have to ask for permission.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Josh Smith: We're gonna have to ask for permission to use their microphone, correct?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Josh Smith: We're gonna have to give them the option to choose which microphone.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Nik Patel: Not necessarily.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Josh Smith: No. Okay, good. Okay.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Nik Patel: No. Um…

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Nik Patel: And I think, especially on the phone, it's just one…

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Nik Patel: And we can ask you that, they say yes, and then we really ask for it, and then they say yes.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Josh Smith: Cool. Um, do you want to just… so, we… we could prompt them beforehand that says vertex… haha, vertex.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Josh Smith: Priority Lens is going to be using… is going to be…

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Josh Smith: blah blah blah, we're gonna be, um, we're gonna be asking you. Or we can just throw them right in and…

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Nik Patel: I think it's better to us say that we will do this, at least for this one.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Nik Patel: Um, we could just say, like.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Nik Patel: Priority lens…

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Nik Patel: We can't…

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Nik Patel: We can essentially say something along the lines of.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Nik Patel: Would you want a guided.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Nik Patel: Onboarding. Skip.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Nik Patel: are, uh…

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Nik Patel: Like, do you want to… do you want to try voice mode?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Nik Patel: Or something like that.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Nik Patel: Right? Or this is the time to introduce the agent.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Nik Patel: Priority Lens has an agent, PLA.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Nik Patel: That you can talk to, do you want to try it out?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Nik Patel: Or, do you want to, uh…

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Nik Patel: Use something along the lines of that you can onboard through that.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Nik Patel: Or, we can take you through just type, type, type for everything else.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Nik Patel: Yep, I'm sure there's a better copy we'll come up with, but…

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Nik Patel: That's the idea.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Josh Smith: Cool.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Josh Smith: blah blah blah, blah blah blah… AI will help us with that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Yep.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Josh Smith: Um, you're just… you're a little further ahead of me… well, not a little, you're way further ahead of me, uh, in, uh, understanding of AI and, um…

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Josh Smith: shifting patterns.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Josh Smith: on what, um…

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Josh Smith: On what you can do.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Josh Smith: What you should be spending time on, and what you no longer need to spend time on.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Josh Smith: So, um…

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Josh Smith: I will adjust.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Josh Smith: So… um…

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Josh Smith: Now, that means there's two experiences. There's the voice assistant experience of onboarding.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Josh Smith: And then there's the…

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Josh Smith: Just…

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Josh Smith: Go along.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Nik Patel: Excellent screens for all of that, yeah.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Nik Patel: Type, type, type.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Type, type, type.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, alright, so let's do the voice, uh, option.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Nik Patel: Actually…

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Nik Patel: Let me throw out an idea, I just thought of this.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Nik Patel: What if it was same experience?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Nik Patel: Just different way of providing an input.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Nik Patel: So we have one additional screen if they put.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Nik Patel: voice, as like, hey, here's I am, here's who I am.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Nik Patel: Here's what we'll do type of, like, a common thing.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Nik Patel: And then the same screen opened up.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Nik Patel: We think these are the 5 things you could say yes, as just, like, a…

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Nik Patel: dip, and…

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Nik Patel: be done with it. Or you could actually hit tap, tap, tap and select in.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Nik Patel: Be done with it.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Josh Smith: Say that again so I understand… sorry.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Nik Patel: So, our personality questions, right, the ones that we had talked about.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Josh Smith: Yep, right down here. Oh, for the person…

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Nik Patel: The first one is, what should I call you?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Nik Patel: That's the first question that we're asking. So let's say that's the first screen that either experience needs to go into.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Nik Patel: Because it's the same piece of information we want, regardless of.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Nik Patel: How they give it to us.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Nik Patel: If it was Voice Agent, it will start with Voice Agent introducing itself.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Nik Patel: Hi, I am Cortex, um…

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Nik Patel: you could talk to me, and I will basically, uh.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Nik Patel: understand all the information that we need, we need covered. Uh, we'll go through a few questions, uh.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, right? Like, it says it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Nik Patel: Or, it's just a simple screen where you just read it out.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Nik Patel: You read it yourself, essentially.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Nik Patel: So that's the only thing where it's a divergence type of a thing, and then it connects again, where the first thing is, what should I call you?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, and there is a small… there is a text box, or a small tip, depending on, like.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Nik Patel: Whatever. Um…

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Nik Patel: what should I call you? Hey, call me Nick.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Nik Patel: I will call you Nick, and that's just more of a conversation, but it gets…

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Nik Patel: Transcripted and closed captioned.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Nik Patel: And the textbooks can… textbooks will be filled itself, and then just move on.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Josh Smith: I see, okay. I'm gonna repeat what you said so I understand.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Josh Smith: With this experience, um…

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I would recommend that.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Josh Smith: Regardless of… well, uh, with the voice-assisted option, that you still have, like.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Josh Smith: The text coming off on the screen.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, like…

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Josh Smith: So, like, as you can see here, they have the intro…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Josh Smith: For starters, what should I call you?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'm gonna put the box there.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Josh Smith: Sorry, I'm gonna drop in a box.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Josh Smith: I'm just gonna do that.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Nik Patel: Oh, I think I… I know, how can I show you what this means.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Nik Patel: Uh, have you seen… have you used Whisperflow?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yeah, yeah, I have. I have it with me.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so Whisper Flow has, uh, if you remember, Whisper Flow's onboarding.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Nik Patel: The way they onboard you is, like, okay, let us turn your…

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Nik Patel: Let's use the microphone, and then you would say yes.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Nik Patel: And then they would take you 3 exercises.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Nik Patel: say this, and then you would, like, press the button, right, function button, and then they will make you talk, and it's like, okay, did the mic move? Yes, mic did move.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Nik Patel: now say this, and then you press the button and say it, and it would just type it out, and you read it, and it's like, great.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Nik Patel: next and next, I think this is similar.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Nik Patel: You could… in this case, you could type it out.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Nik Patel: If you wanted to, or we could just, like, take that…

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Nik Patel: We could just hide that piece of it.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Nik Patel: the voice piece of it, and you're just, like, simply, what should I call you? And then you just type the name and hit submit.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay. And…

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Josh Smith: would you like that experience of teaching someone to use, like, with Whisperflow in the beginning?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Josh Smith: Or are you saying…

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Josh Smith: Giving them, uh…

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Josh Smith: Giving them guidance on using a keystroke prompt to speak.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Nik Patel: So this… I'm assuming that will be on mobile by default.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Josh Smith: If they're mobile by default.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Josh Smith: You think there should be, like, a microphone…

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Josh Smith: A big circle microphone, but no.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Nik Patel: Just simply talk. Like, I would talk with the chat GPT thing, right? Just simply talk and we'll get it covered.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Josh Smith: Simply Talk.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Simply talk. Okay.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Nik Patel: what I was rather going to was…

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Nik Patel: what I'm thinking about is.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Nik Patel: We have two options. We just, essentially, for voice mode.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Nik Patel: It could simply be, I'm gonna ask you a question, the question shows up.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Nik Patel: Whatever you say gets written down on its own.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Nik Patel: Cap trade.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Nik Patel: Hit next or something. Let's go to next thing, and we just directly go to next thing.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Nik Patel: That's the voice experience. With the text experience.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Nik Patel: That blue circle goes away.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Nik Patel: And it's just simply, uh, some sort of, like, a…

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Nik Patel: onboarding, assistant.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Nik Patel: Not clippy, but something like that.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Nik Patel: That just says, we are onboarding you, and then you just start typing, and then hit submit next, next, next.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Nik Patel: Or skip, either way.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Josh Smith: Yes, and the, uh, where I'm, where I'm getting, um.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Josh Smith: where I'm getting stuck is, um…

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Josh Smith: How do we allow somebody to determine which one they want to do?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Josh Smith: at what point? So, like.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Josh Smith: We keep…

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Nik Patel: stop here. After OTP, it says, would you like to try voice-assisted onboarding agent?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Nik Patel: If they say, let's go.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Josh Smith: Let's go. It goes to this.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Nik Patel: Yep, I'd rather go it alone.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Josh Smith: If they mistake.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Nik Patel: We need some… we are preparing a personalized experience for you. In the meantime, we need XYZ pieces of information.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Josh Smith: Give me a moment.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm. And by the way, did you hear from any of your friends on…

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Nik Patel: What they recommend for a component library?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Josh Smith: Uh, I asked my friends, um, their response was, I don't know of any for a while.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Josh Smith: For voice. Uh, so I was like, alright, well, and I already know they would recommend Tailwind, so I sent them Shad.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Josh Smith: Like, well, in the least, what are your thoughts on Shad? And they said, oh yeah, that's very well known, and it's a good one to pick. I'm like, okay.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Josh Smith: But yeah, I couldn't find, um…

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Josh Smith: They were, like, they were stumped on the whole AI voice stuff.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Josh Smith: Yes, you can watch it too.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Nik Patel: No worries.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Josh Smith: So, in… in place of this, it would be like, um…

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Josh Smith: It would be this.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Nik Patel: Pretty much, yeah.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, okay.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. And if you're saying that this is… most of the time this is going to be on mobile.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna, um…

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Josh Smith: Oops. Swap those, Josh.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna…

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Josh Smith: Wireframe for mobile.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Nik Patel: For what it's worth, I like the idea of.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Nik Patel: Pushing them on mobile more.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Josh Smith: Sure.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Nik Patel: It's easier to start with mobile and less.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Nik Patel: screen asset, and then going and saying, oh, I can add more to this.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Josh Smith: Let's do it.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Josh Smith: You say stuff, and uh, this whole, this whole, the name here.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Josh Smith: Um… I'm gonna put a comment here that, um…

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Josh Smith: Well, I'll put a design, um…

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Josh Smith: I'll draw it, because…

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Josh Smith: You know, like, the voice, um…

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Josh Smith: The voice, and it's, like, some…

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Josh Smith: Something that's responding to your voice as you're talking.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Nik Patel: Yep, as you're talking, yep.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Josh Smith: And… once it believes it's got the information, then it'll input it.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Josh Smith: Makes sense.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Josh Smith: Yes, buddy. Yes, I can.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Josh Smith: Is that for my computer?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Josh Smith: You can go, Chris. Chris?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Josh Smith: That's you in, like, 6 to 8 years.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Josh Smith: Right?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Josh Smith: Next is, um…

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Josh Smith: I'm looking through XYZ, while I do that, let's get to know you a bit more.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Josh Smith: What's on the top of your mind today?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, I don't think it needs to write out everything they say.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, now in… sorry.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Josh Smith: I could.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Nik Patel: Question. So…

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Nik Patel: Do we…

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I think…

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I think that's the right question. Makes sense.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Josh Smith: It could summarize.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, that's the right question. I'm thinking, like, what would that be in the writing mode? Because we don't want them to be writing essays, so, like.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Nik Patel: What can we ask that is easier to type to?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Josh Smith: Ah, yes, yes.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Josh Smith: That's a challenge, yeah, you don't want them to be, like.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Josh Smith: I didn't realize I was signing up for a journaling app.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Josh Smith: I don't journal. Um…

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Josh Smith: Well…

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Josh Smith: With most experiences, it's like a multi-select.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Josh Smith: What are you intending to use this for? Personal work?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Josh Smith: you know, the basic questions that I can never understand how it helps, like, the product.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Josh Smith: at all. Is it…

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Josh Smith: Is it a… do you feel like it's still essential to pull, somehow, some semblance of information.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Josh Smith: In text… in the text type.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Josh Smith: Experience for this, or to just skip these altogether, these freeform.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Nik Patel: That's… that's exactly what I was thinking in my mind. Do we just skip that part?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Nik Patel: The hard part is we need time.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Nik Patel: To do the analysis behind the scene.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Nik Patel: Right? So we are… with these questions, we're essentially buying the time for the system to actually do the work.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Josh Smith: Mm-mm.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Josh Smith: Ah, okay.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Um…

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Josh Smith: there is a section here, personality questions. You had… you mentioned one that was, like.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Josh Smith: Are you a last-minute person, or do you prepare beforehand?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Josh Smith: Is that an area you wanted to exp…

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Josh Smith: We wanted to expand on and provide a series of very personality-specific questions to get a sense of where, you know, where they are, um.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I think that's… that's good. Um, the other question could be…

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Nik Patel: When are you at your best, or what's your focus time?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Nik Patel: focus… block.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Nik Patel: Morning, early… or late afternoon, early afternoon, late evening, whatever.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Nik Patel: Right? Because we could ask that, and then in the…

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Nik Patel: Type more, it's just select.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Nik Patel: 2 or 3 boxes, and you're done, so it doesn't feel like you need to type anything.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Yeah.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Josh Smith: It's one of those, like, don't skip the questions where we could probably prompt.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Josh Smith: with a couple.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Josh Smith: All others we could skip.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Josh Smith: What's on top of your mind is…

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Josh Smith: Do you want to take some… should we spend some time refining the question list together, or…

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Nik Patel: He should.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so what's on the top of your mind today? That first question assumes we're asking, like, what's most imp…

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Josh Smith: What's most important for you right now?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, is there anything in particular you have to get done today?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Josh Smith: Is that instead of top of mind?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, and that's a closed question, that's just a yes or no.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Josh Smith: do you… do we want to follow up from that? They would say, oh, if they say yes, oh, what is it?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Nik Patel: Um, just ask them, like, what do you want to get? Like, what do you want?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Josh Smith: Or… or do you…

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Nik Patel: What do you have to get done tonight? Or something like that.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Nik Patel: What's the most important.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Nik Patel: Item that you are expecting to get done, or…

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Josh Smith: Alright, what's the most important thing you have to get done today?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Josh Smith: What's on your list?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. And they could talk, they could type.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Nik Patel: Doesn't matter.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Josh Smith: Um, now you, you asked, uh, another one, like, what are you excited about? Um, is that…

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Josh Smith: So is that more like, um…

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Josh Smith: Help, uh, helping understand, like.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Josh Smith: helping AI understand… what does that help with?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Nik Patel: My mind… my thinking there was, like.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Nik Patel: That would tell us, like, any type of a project that they're thinking about.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Nik Patel: And we can start to think through that.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Nik Patel: Um, same on the second one, it will just still give us a project, but we know, like.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Nik Patel: One's a stressful project, and one's an exciting project, in a way.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yep.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Nik Patel: Like, what type of things they like, and…

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Nik Patel: I hate my work, but I love going for biking in the afternoon, whatever.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, kinda like, what do you do to relax?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Nik Patel: Right, but relaxed is not gonna help.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Nik Patel: with… it's a great question, in my mind. What I'm trying to understand is how can it help us make a decision for the screens that we're gonna show after?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Nik Patel: like, focus block is a good one, right? Like, I know if their focus block is in the morning, I'm gonna start.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Nik Patel: blocking that more to keep them that… give them that time, and okay, I can show the value of the platform.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Nik Patel: So, what are the questions like that?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Josh Smith: Uh, let's ask ChatGPT.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Nik Patel: Oh, oh. I think there is a question that would be really good.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Nik Patel: What's your communication style?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Nik Patel: Because then we can write all the communication recommendation with that tone.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Nik Patel: And that could be just, like, a bunch of…

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Nik Patel: You know, checkboxes they could select.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Nik Patel: And stuff like that. If they're…

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Nik Patel: basically did that.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: We have spaces? No spaces, all in… all lowercase.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Josh Smith: What's your most preferred communication style? Okay, we can ask ChatGBT what the most popular.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Josh Smith: Answers are for that.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, names are whatnot. And what I was thinking is, even on the voice, we could say.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Nik Patel: So, for example, what's the most important thing you have to get done today?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Nik Patel: Um, escort, uh, for example.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Nik Patel: My most important thing is to onboard you and make sure your projects are in order.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Nik Patel: So, it gives them an example.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Nik Patel: Of, like, what their answers could look like, too.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Nik Patel: From a voice perspective, where it's completely open if you need to guide.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Nik Patel: them. That might be one way to guide them.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Nik Patel: And this section could be, let's get to know each other.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Nik Patel: Sounds like a dating, but…

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Nik Patel: Do you think it's a good idea to go like this, or is it too logical, or…

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Nik Patel: Not fun enough.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Nik Patel: Or no, this is good.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Josh Smith: If you, um, it takes me forever to think through things and give you answers, so that's why I… sometimes I don't respond.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, I don't know, Bo, prompt.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Josh Smith: Bo warned you about that. Um…

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Josh Smith: I personally get excited about this.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Josh Smith: Um… I don't know if I'm the majority.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Josh Smith: I prefer talking.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Josh Smith: I could sit down and…

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Josh Smith: if I had an onboarding experience where I didn't have to click a thing.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Josh Smith: And the thing just said… the AI just said, hey, yo, what should I call you? And I'm like, just call me Josh.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, that's all good. Uh, and then, uh, yeah, and then it asked, um.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Josh Smith: And then it's like, okay, great, I'm looking through XYZ, while I do it, let's get to know you more.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, first question, you know…

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Josh Smith: Very open-ended.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Josh Smith: What's the most important thing you have to get done today? Take your time.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Josh Smith: And then I just talk. Um…

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Josh Smith: what I prefer personally, I'm getting down to the weeds, sorry, is for it to be, like.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Josh Smith: When you're done, say… say, I'm done.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Josh Smith: Because the thing I hate about ChatGPT is, like, I'm trying to talk to it, and I pause a lot.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Josh Smith: And I pause to think, and the moment I stop to think, it starts to talk, and I'm like.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Josh Smith: Dude, I'm still figuring that… I'm still trying to think here and talk.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Josh Smith: Um… but, um…

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Josh Smith: if I were to just be like, yeah, well, let me think about that, let me talk that through, and I know that chat… that the tool is recording everything I say, so I'm like, okay, cool, I'm just gonna talk.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Josh Smith: Uh… and I go, okay, well…

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Josh Smith: if someone asked me what's the most important thing you have to do today, I'd say, oh gosh, well, there's several things. Let me talk through them, because I need to talk that through so I can figure out what is the most important thing.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Josh Smith: So I'll be like, okay, well, I'm doing this today, I'm doing this today.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Josh Smith: I might even be like, I'm doing this today, but I hate it, it's soul-sucking.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Josh Smith: But I know that's the most important thing to get done today.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Josh Smith: Um, I have to do this accessibility thing, and I've been holding that off because I'm just like…

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Josh Smith: I have to connect with people that won't get back to me.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Josh Smith: I would respond that way.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Josh Smith: And then I'd be like… and then I'd say, I know… I usually say this to everyone, I know this… that was way more than you were asking for. I'm done.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Josh Smith: That's what I would do.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Josh Smith: Um… sorry.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Nik Patel: I think that's a good question. I'm wondering, and I don't know if we can technically do it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Nik Patel: Um… but…

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Nik Patel: what I was thinking is, what if that was one thing, is like, what would you like this top word to be?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Nik Patel: I could wait for you to stop talking and I'll start processing, or do you… do you have a word where, when you say that.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Nik Patel: I should wait for you to say that word, or click something, or something like that, right?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Nik Patel: So it could be that.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I…

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Nik Patel: Because, yeah, I have the similar experience with ChatGPT.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Nik Patel: They have this 500 millisecond or a second of pause, and, like, it starts processing right away?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Nik Patel: Right?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and I just…

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Josh Smith: it gives me anxiety, because I'm like…

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Josh Smith: I'm not done yet. Especially if you're in, like, a room.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Josh Smith: like, whenever I'm in meetings.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Josh Smith: and I'm talking, other people will do that. They'll, like, jump in, and I'll be like, damn it.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Josh Smith: You gotta shut up. I'm still… I'm still trying to talk.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Nik Patel: Makes sense. Um, speaking of that, uh, does it make sense to provide, like.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Nik Patel: Nah, it's fine, it's too much. I was thinking, like.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Nik Patel: Make sure you are in an area that is.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Nik Patel: Not loud or something like that, but let's not worry about it right now.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Josh Smith: So that's… so that… I was thinking about that too, but that might be satisfied with this… this…

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Josh Smith: Section, uh, you were considering.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, um…

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Josh Smith: you know, hi, I'm blah blah blah, your voice assistant agent.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Josh Smith: Um, Priority Lynn, um…

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Josh Smith: Would you like… would you like to try me?

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Josh Smith: Would you like me to try me out? Or…

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Josh Smith: Or, um…

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Josh Smith: And yeah.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Nik Patel: I think that's a… that's a screen after.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Nik Patel: So, we have this…

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Nik Patel: We have a voice onboarding, um, voice assistant that can onboard you, would you want to try that?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Nik Patel: Uh, if they say, let's go, that's when we have to start about, I'm gonna ask for Microsoft, or Microsoft, uh, microphone permission.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Nik Patel: please, uh, say yes. Like, we have to get some of that going.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Nik Patel: Before it goes into anything else.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Josh Smith: Mm, gotcha.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Josh Smith: So, this is more like the Whisper Flow onboarding.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Nik Patel: Right, that portion… that portion has to be WhisperFlow, because.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Nik Patel: Safe to assume that we did not have microphone permission then.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Uh, and then we could also do, um…

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, prompt them to say, like, you know.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Josh Smith: Um, you could ask them, you mentioned, like, you could ask them, what do you want your, um.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Josh Smith: what do you want your undone phrase to be? Or you could just say… you just tell them you're…

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Josh Smith: say I'm done, and…

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Josh Smith: We'll know… will know to… to… to answer.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, either one, it's just different levels of effort at this moment.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Uh, it could be actually as… for that, it could be as simple as…

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Nik Patel: You had two modes to talk, um…

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Nik Patel: if you just talk, when you stop talking, I'll… I'll process and…

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Nik Patel: Answer, or you could just press this button.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Nik Patel: Like a push to talk.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Josh Smith: Ah, okay.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Josh Smith: Oh, push to talk or push to note… push to be done?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Nik Patel: Well…

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Nik Patel: So, push to be… I'm… I'm…

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Josh Smith: Hold to talk?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Nik Patel: Hold to talk, yeah, I think. Hold to talk, or just talk. Which one do you prefer?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Nik Patel: So, like, in the Whisper flow, it's a hold to talk.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Nik Patel: Right, and you can think as long as you want, as long as you are holding that button.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Nik Patel: In our case, yeah, it's similar. Hold2Talk, or…

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Nik Patel: Uh, let me try something.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Nik Patel: You hear me fine?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I can hear you fine.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Nik Patel: This is what it does. Okay, so it's got…

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Nik Patel: I can't see myself, hold on.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Nik Patel: Uh, some… anyway, can you see this?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Nik Patel: You see there is an up… the right icon up top?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Josh Smith: No, I can't lower it, lower it a bit.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Nik Patel: I think…

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Josh Smith: Oh no, now your computer is zooming in and zooming out.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I see that it's listening right now, and it's… that's what we need, that doing that thing, and then…

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Nik Patel: Yep, and then up top on the right-hand side, there is a check mark.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Oh, to be done.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Nik Patel: That's the way… yes, that's what WhisperFlow's doing.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Josh Smith: Oh, can you hold that up again? Sorry.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Nik Patel: Yes, give me one sec.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Josh Smith: Ha ha ha ha.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh, so, okay, yeah, yeah, you just took the screenshot yourself. Oh, well, I was gonna screenshot it, but you can…

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Nik Patel: I'll just send it here, yep.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Nik Patel: I'll just text you. I'm assuming you're on Mac?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Josh Smith: Yes, I am.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so I can text you and it will make it to you, or…

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Josh Smith: Gosh, I have an… I also have a startup with my brother.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yes. Uh, by the way, he did…

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Nik Patel: him doing wipe coding and just getting it done is pretty amazing. That's a scrib…

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Nik Patel: Skibbity? Yes.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, skibbity!

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Josh Smith: Oh, man.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Nik Patel: I talked with him once, um, I think something was…

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Nik Patel: Boa had… was chat chatting with him, and, like, we were talking about something, so I had chat with him once. Pretty, pretty cool thing.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, he was just fooling around. Uh, we were still fooling, but we're still working on it. We're like, oh, you know, like, um…

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, but, uh…

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Josh Smith: What was I gonna say? Oh, he has a PC.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Josh Smith: So it's so frustrating, because I'm like, I can't text you anything.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Josh Smith: I'm like, let me text you a Zoom link. I'm like, I can't text you a Zoom link.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Josh Smith: Email it to you, my goodness.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Nik Patel: I have both, and I feel the pain, so…

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, there we go, and I'll…

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Josh Smith: There you go. And this was just as easy as dragging it over.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I see.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Josh Smith: So, in this sense, this is kind of like, um…

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Josh Smith: Okay. This is push… this is…

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Josh Smith: This is not hold to talk, this is… this is nice, because this is kind of, like, best of both worlds.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Josh Smith: We're listening to you, you let us know when you're done.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Josh Smith: Uh, well, that's not… that's not the other mode, which is…

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Josh Smith: the ChatGPT mode, which is, um…

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Josh Smith: We'll listen to you, and we'll…

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Josh Smith: We'll, uh, you're done when we…

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Josh Smith: We noticed you stopped talking.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so both of those options.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Nik Patel: And do you think we need both options, or do we just, like, not give them that option?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Josh Smith: I think down the road, you could expand both of those options.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Josh Smith: I think, uh, uh, out the gate.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Josh Smith: I'd probably mirror what Whisperflow's doing out the gate.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Nik Patel: Which is actually… I have to tap it every time.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Josh Smith: Oh, with… I was assuming that with this.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Josh Smith: It's… it's, um…

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Josh Smith: No, no, we could give them both options.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Josh Smith: Um, it's, it's the, do you, do you want to allow them to switch between them during the onboarding experience, or when they select it at the beginning, that's what they get?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Josh Smith: Okay? Alright, so that's where, like, that's where the…

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Josh Smith: The scope, uh, shaving would be, like…

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Josh Smith: for V1, whatever they choose is what they get.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Nik Patel: And also, like, it's also… I had to build more, I had to think through more, more states behind the scene on the app.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. So, getting this out…

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Josh Smith: what's a… what's a… what's a… I call it version later, or V later, like…

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Josh Smith: What do we put a card in for V later on this?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Nik Patel: I'm just thinking, like, which one would be a better experience?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, uh, if I had to choose between the two, it would be the Whisper Flow Tap to Be Done experience, because it gives you more control.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Josh Smith: And any… and any…

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Josh Smith: For… for folks who aren't as used to this tool.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Josh Smith: Having more control is more…

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Josh Smith: Important than having less.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Josh Smith: But for people who are more experienced with it, who already know ChatGPT and use it.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Josh Smith: They may prefer not having to tap every time.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Nik Patel: Yep, and I'm also thinking, like, down the road.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Nik Patel: So, like, assume we have gone through onboarding, I come back, I want to talk with this voice agent again.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Nik Patel: Do I want that expi…

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Nik Patel: If I had to hold and I had to tap every time, I need phone in front of me.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Josh Smith: Oh. Yeah.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Nik Patel: And that's not a good experience. I want to be able to talk to it without even looking at the device.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Nik Patel: So, like, I'm on my airport, I'm walking, and it knows what I'm doing. In that case, ChatGPT is a better experience.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Josh Smith: You…

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Nik Patel: So I'm just… torn on that.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Josh Smith: You…

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Josh Smith: So you want this experience to eventually be on every time… on all the time.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Nik Patel: On with something that they click, and it just moves into that mode.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Nik Patel: Just like, you know how in ChatGPT you click that thing and it's just that mode by default?

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yep.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Josh Smith: I see.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Josh Smith: So… what about…

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Josh Smith: what I was assuming, though.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Josh Smith: Is that this is on all the time.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Josh Smith: Um… either… oh, okay, I…

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Josh Smith: This is on all the time in this onboarding experience, it's just…

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Josh Smith: I see.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Nik Patel: Like, it would work now?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Nik Patel: But then, if I want to go hands-free.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Nik Patel: that hold to dock doesn't work. I can't do WhisperFlow hands-free.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Josh Smith: Which is… which is why, like.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Josh Smith: a, um…

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Josh Smith: you could use a phrase, too, and I know that's not…

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Josh Smith: I can't think of a comparable experience where they do this.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Josh Smith: But if you say, like.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Josh Smith: I'm finished, I'm done, or some sort of…

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Josh Smith: Keyphrase, you could be hands-free.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, or we're a lot… or we're… or I'm… I'm introducing too much thinking on this.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Josh Smith: And you just go out the gate with it being ChatGPT experience, and it…

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Josh Smith: And if you're… if you're…

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Josh Smith: The only problem with that is that…

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Josh Smith: It…

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Josh Smith: If it goes… if it advances, auto-advances to the next question, you're like, wait, hold on, I had more to say.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Nik Patel: I had more to say, yeah.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Josh Smith: You could be, like, you could have buttons that say.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Josh Smith: You could have buttons that say, next question.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Josh Smith: Or I want to, I want to talk about this more, or, like, I want to say more.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Josh Smith: Could do that.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Josh Smith: Where…

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Josh Smith: At least for the onboarding experience, they would have to hit a button to go to the next question.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Josh Smith: If they felt like they needed more to say, they could.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Josh Smith: And you could pop up and have them chat some more.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Josh Smith: But…

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Josh Smith: This is… this is one of those, though…

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Josh Smith: I start answering this question.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Josh Smith: Um, what's the most important thing you have to get done today?

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Josh Smith: And… I'm not done answering it.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Josh Smith: In ChatGPT world.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Josh Smith: It's a dialogue.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Josh Smith: It's a running dialogue.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Josh Smith: In this world.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Josh Smith: Is it a running dialogue until…

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Josh Smith: You feel like you've sufficiently answered the question, or is it…

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Josh Smith: I, I, I say one answer.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Josh Smith: And this… the system is expecting to just take it in and be like.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Josh Smith: Great, here's what I'm hearing.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Josh Smith: Done. No dialogue.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Nik Patel: I think it's dialogue, for what it's worth, um, but asking for confirmation every time doesn't make sense either.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Josh Smith: If it's di… if it's running dialogue, then, um…

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Nik Patel: Because we could go into that dialogue mode, right?

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Josh Smith: If it's running dialogue, then we don't have to force them to say they're done.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Josh Smith: Because you could… if it's running dialogue.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Josh Smith: They could respond, be like.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Josh Smith: For instance, this tool could be like, okay, well, here's what I'm hearing, is that accurate?

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Josh Smith: Yo, yeah, you got that pretty well signed up.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Josh Smith: Great. Is there… is there anything else you'd like to share about this? No, I'm good.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Josh Smith: Okay, great, let's go to the next question.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Nik Patel: But doing that for, like, 6, 5, 6 questions back-to-back.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Nik Patel: Doesn't feel like… like, every time you're asking me, what kind of smart are you, right?

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Nik Patel: If that makes sense.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Josh Smith: Oh… oh, you think by prompting, hey.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Josh Smith: Is there anything else you'd like to add to this?

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Nik Patel: on every question?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Josh Smith: You feel like that is…

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Josh Smith: That the… it should know when they're done.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Nik Patel: Here's what I think we could do, and I'm just gonna throw out this idea.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Nik Patel: And I don't know how I'm gonna even build this, but I'll just say it out loud for now.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Nik Patel: If we don't hear anything for 2 seconds, we just prompt to say.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Nik Patel: Hey, I haven't heard you talking, are you still thinking?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Great, take your time. Uh, just say, I'm done when you're…

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Nik Patel: When, um, when you're ready to move on… when you're ready for me to process.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Nik Patel: Or something along those lines.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, could do that. It's a fallback.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Josh Smith: That's a fallback in the instance where they asked the question.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Josh Smith: You don't answer it immediately.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Nik Patel: I answer, and then I stop for 2 seconds, it will just, like, prompt me to say I haven't…

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Nik Patel: It seems like you stopped talking, are you still thinking? Yes.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um…

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Nik Patel: Let me know when you're done, just say done when you're done, and uh…

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Nik Patel: I'll process and we'll move on to the next thing.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Josh Smith: Though that would trigger every single time.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Josh Smith: Because once the person is done talking.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Josh Smith: You would have… you'd be… you'd…

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, we did…

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, we wouldn't get them in the hybrid in the one… one…

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Nik Patel: instance.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Josh Smith: Fun.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Nik Patel: So let's, let's do this, um…

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Nik Patel: I think here's what we could do. So, if they stop talking, we'll start processing, like, chat GPT.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Nik Patel: But we should give them a back button.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Nik Patel: But with the back button, they could add more info.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Nik Patel: For now, we'll go with this, we'll see how it works out.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so it auto-advances.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Nik Patel: For now, yeah.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Josh Smith: They have the option to go back if they want.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Josh Smith: Going back doesn't erase what they did.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Josh Smith: Going back supplements what they did.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Nik Patel: supplements what they did. Or, uh, if it goes to the next one, and I really had to figure out how it's gonna work out now.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Nik Patel: Because there's so many dynamic things that could happen, but let's say…

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Nik Patel: For starters, what should I call you? Nik?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Nik Patel: Hey, Nick, great to meet you.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Nik Patel: I'm looking through your…

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Nik Patel: Priorities, emails, projects, contacts, and meetings.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Nik Patel: While I process that, uh, let's get to know each other a little bit more.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Nik Patel: My goal today is to onboard you.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Nik Patel: Onto the platform, and make sure you're all set to go, or you're all set.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Nik Patel: one thing that's… that I'd love to know is what's, uh…

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Nik Patel: Important… what's the most important thing you have to get done today?

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Nik Patel: Oh, do many things.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Nik Patel: And then I stopped for 3 seconds.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Nik Patel: Right? It shouldn't move on.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Nik Patel: It seems like you're still thinking, uh, type of thing.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I'm doing this, I'm doing that, blah blah blah.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Nik Patel: And then it says, okay, I made a note of that, my next…

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Nik Patel: Uh, thing is…

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Nik Patel: What's on top of your mind?

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Nik Patel: Before we talk about what's on top of my mind, I forgot that I also have this on my list.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Nik Patel: And I should be able to answer it there.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Nik Patel: then it should be done, and then I move on to the next thing.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Nik Patel: So I just need to figure out, like, how can we keep it, like, that level of…

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Nik Patel: smart, but I'm assuming there is something out there that can help me do that, or will build it.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Nik Patel: Alright, so…

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Nik Patel: did that, um…

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Josh Smith: What's the most important thing you have to get done today?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Josh Smith: Uh, next question is…

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Josh Smith: What are you most excited about?

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Nik Patel: What's your preferred communication style?

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Josh Smith: What's your preferred communications?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Josh Smith: Uh, so there's a heuristic recognize over recall.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Josh Smith: what your preferred communication style is, that sentence is phrased in a way.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Josh Smith: that woo, um…

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Josh Smith: It would benefit the user to have.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Josh Smith: Options they could recognize to select from.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Josh Smith: There might be other ways you can ask the question to allow them to retrospect or think about or talk about.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Josh Smith: their communication style.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Josh Smith: Or how they speak with others.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Josh Smith: If you want that kind of dialogue.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Nik Patel: Yes, agree. I think there are actually two questions.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Nik Patel: How do you like to communicate with people?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Nik Patel: And how do you want people to communicate.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Nik Patel: with you.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Nik Patel: Right, so, like, for me, someone…

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Nik Patel: Matter of fact, here's the things, here's what we need to know, here's the decision we need to make.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Nik Patel: But when I'm communicating with others, I try to provide as much context as possible.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Nik Patel: So something along those lines. I think those two questions.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Nik Patel: between these three questions, I think we get, what, like, about 30, 40 seconds of time in general?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Nik Patel: I think that's… uh… that's more than enough, so we can skip the whole…

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Nik Patel: Most excited about, biggest concern?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Nik Patel: Staff?

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Josh Smith: Okay?

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Nik Patel: It doesn't tell us what projects, though.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Nik Patel: It's fine, we'll figure it out. Um…

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Nik Patel: And then we can still ask these two questions.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Nik Patel: When are you best, uh, to focus, and then…

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Nik Patel: Are you a last-minute person, or do you like to prepare?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Josh Smith: With the project stuff, it's like, um…

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Josh Smith: Well, what's the most important thing you have to get done today? It's project-related.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Nik Patel: It's a task in general.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Nik Patel: Because they would just respond with tasks, not a project, right? They're not gonna say, oh, I have, like.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Nik Patel: this thing coming to you in 3 months, and I need to think about it today. It's mostly gonna be…

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Nik Patel: I had this meeting coming up, I need to prepare for it.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Nik Patel: I need to do my blah today.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Josh Smith: So, because that question is open-ended.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Josh Smith: People will answer it at different levels.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Josh Smith: at, like, the…

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Josh Smith: the, uh…

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Josh Smith: The ground, the trees, the whole forest.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Josh Smith: So you might get, you might get, um, a mix.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Josh Smith: That would tell you… that could tell you, actually.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Josh Smith: Where they are in their experience, and where they are in an organization.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, because…

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Josh Smith: If you ask me what's the most important thing you have to get done today.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Josh Smith: I'd say… the way I would respond, honestly, I would say, alright, well, I have to hit a sales goal of…

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Josh Smith: You know, 50 customers.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Josh Smith: By the end of, um…

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Josh Smith: our sales, uh, our sales year, and…

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Josh Smith: Um, in order to do that.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, I need to…

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Josh Smith: Uh, identify the most important.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Josh Smith: features for…

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Josh Smith: Uh, to build next.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Josh Smith: I have to put a list together right now for mobile.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Josh Smith: uh, and what those are, I don't even know if…

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Josh Smith: I can get those done, so I need to start that project.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Josh Smith: That's probably how I would respond.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Josh Smith: It's like, I… I'd be like, okay, I wanna go… I wanna… I…

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Josh Smith: Been trained to help people land the plane.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Josh Smith: in conversation all the time, that I would do that. But, you're right, somebody who's just like a…

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Josh Smith: An engineer, or who's always been, um.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Josh Smith: uh, individual contributor.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Josh Smith: They might respond with a task.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Josh Smith: You're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, Josh.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Nik Patel: No, it makes sense. I'm thinking, like.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Nik Patel: Am I creating a profile for them behind the scene, either way?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Nik Patel: Because, yeah, if they do respond with projects mindset, it's like, okay, this person is more strategic, like, make a note of that, and…

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Nik Patel: Put that in a memory of something.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Nik Patel: That's what I was thinking, um…

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, you could… you could suss that out at that question, how to answer it.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Nik Patel: Okay. So we have 3 questions.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Josh Smith: Settlement.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Nik Patel: We could ask two more.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Nik Patel: Like, on one side, I want to figure out.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Nik Patel: the projects more that they have on their list. On the other side, it's like.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Nik Patel: Are you the last-minute person? What's the best?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Nik Patel: When do you have the most energy to get the work done?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Nik Patel: Is it your early mornings, or is it…

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Nik Patel: Some different time, or whatnot, you know?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah. Um…

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, when are you best… when are you at your best to focus as, like, um…

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, let me think, because I'm just thinking about how I would answer that.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Josh Smith: If I answer that, I'd be like, um…

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Josh Smith: I hate waking up early, but when I wake up early…

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Josh Smith: I can focus, because everyone else is asleep.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Josh Smith: Otherwise, I'm a night owl, because.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Josh Smith: everyone is asleep. So…

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Nik Patel: Sleep, yeah.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Josh Smith: My best focus time is…

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Josh Smith: When the world is not…

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Josh Smith: in motion, like, when everything else is done. That's when I focus. Everything else, I'm just…

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Josh Smith: Meeting, you know, meeting, meeting, meeting.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Josh Smith: all the… the noise. Um, that's how I would answer that one. Are you a last-minute person you prepare? I'd say, yeah, and then if I were to answer that, I'd be like, yeah, I'm a total procrastinator.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, I function well under high-stress environments.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Josh Smith: And I feel like I think best when that happens, so…

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Josh Smith: Sometimes I hold things off, but it's not because I'm a procrastinator, it's because I am thinking.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Josh Smith: Constantly about it.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Nik Patel: All the time, yes, till the last minute.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Josh Smith: And planning exactly how to execute.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Josh Smith: And I executed the last minute.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, same, I'm the same way.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I think… so these are good questions. We won't get the projects figured out with this.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Nik Patel: Uh, we'll see how it goes when I actually put it in action, if we need to put different questions to get more information for the next ones.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Josh Smith: Okay, um, and…

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Josh Smith: You're trying to be… I hear 5 questions, I'm assuming you're trying to be sensitive of the point at which they start to get fatigued.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Um, decision paralysis doesn't come into play here because you're not deciding anything, and that's usually, like, 3 to 5.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Josh Smith: Before… 3 to 5 options in one…

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Josh Smith: Setting before people just slow down and they don't know what… they suddenly don't know what to do anymore.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Josh Smith: But, um, so, yeah, I'll have to test, what, 3 to 5 answers.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Josh Smith: Um, oh, what I usually do with these is I do, like, a stepped, uh, a visual.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Josh Smith: Um… I'm just gonna do, like, a really shitty-looking one, just to… just to…

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Nik Patel: Oh, just the process of, this is how far you are in the process, type of thing? Yeah.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Josh Smith: Yes, yes.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Nik Patel: 1 of 2, or 1 of 5, or whatever, okay.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and I usually… sometimes, if I don't want to be, like.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Josh Smith: don't want to create too much more noise, I make it, like, purely visual.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, and I'll… yeah, so I'll do, like…

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Josh Smith: I'll do, like, that.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Josh Smith: Something at the top, so…

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Josh Smith: You know…

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Josh Smith: I'm… I'm behind there, but…

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Josh Smith: So, I'm just gonna put this here just as a reminder that this is gonna help.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Josh Smith: You… when you were talking this morning, you were saying, um…

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Josh Smith: There's an, are these the folks you communicate with the most?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Josh Smith: Are you… are you, are you, um…

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Josh Smith: Before I keep going, I have a crash-out period where I just, like.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Josh Smith: Can't think.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Nik Patel: Oh yeah, no, I can go as long as we need to.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Nik Patel: Stay focused, and…

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Nik Patel: be involved, that's all good. I'm just thinking, uh, after this fifth one.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Nik Patel: There's 3 things that could happen.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Nik Patel: One is…

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Nik Patel: We are ready to actually show them the next things.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Nik Patel: Projects, people, stuff.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Nik Patel: We are not ready to show them things.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Nik Patel: In which case, we have to show some sort of, like, uh, in-between screen.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Nik Patel: Right? We are preparing this for you, give us a couple seconds.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Nik Patel: And then in a few seconds, we have to be ready.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Nik Patel: With whatever we got at that time.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Nik Patel: So I'm just thinking about all those things as, like.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Nik Patel: at what point do I just say, like, alright.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Nik Patel: 5 seconds more, and then you have to start. And even if it's two things we found, so be it, and just show two options. If you found 5, so be it.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I see.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Josh Smith: I see, because you don't want them hanging on a loading screen for too long.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, cause that's not a good experience either.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, uh, especially a loading screen with, like, a…

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Nik Patel: no idea of what to expect next, right? Like.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Josh Smith: Loading spirits with no…

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Josh Smith: perception of advancement.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Josh Smith: eventually feels broken, yeah. So, like…

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Josh Smith: like, the Google loading states I hate, because it's just, like, an animation that's just going over and over and over again.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Josh Smith: They're cute that, like, when the loading is done, the animation, like.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Josh Smith: goes to an end state. It's like, oh, that's cool, but in that middle period, I'm like.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Nik Patel: changes the name. Yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Josh Smith: And I get it.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Nik Patel: They don't know either.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and I, and I get, yeah, and I get the loading bars, we've all lived through the loading bars that are, like, at… it's, like, at 10% for an hour, and then it goes to 100% the next minute after.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Josh Smith: It's like, no, that's helpful. Um, is there a perception of time you can give them to say, like, eh…

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Josh Smith: But then, even, like, you're like, give me about 5 minutes, they're like, oh god, no, I'm not gonna wait 5 minutes.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I'm just gonna get out of the app, we are done.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I'm gonna leave, I'm done, yeah.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Josh Smith: So… and I guess right now, you don't have a sense of…

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Josh Smith: You don't have a sense of how long it's gonna take, correct?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. For now, let's just, uh, put 54321 or something, and then that gives me an additional 5 seconds, or…

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Josh Smith: Oh, you, you want, like, a, like a countdown, like a…

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Josh Smith: Uh, is that what you're saying? Like, uh…

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Nik Patel: That's what I was thinking.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Nik Patel: The other thing that would be actually pretty cool is…

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Nik Patel: You have seen Canva's style that fills up?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Josh Smith: No.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Nik Patel: Now, uh, do you use Canva?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Josh Smith: No. I know.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Josh Smith: No, I don't. I should, but I'm, uh…

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Nik Patel: Let me actually show you something. This is… the way they do it, it's pretty cool, actually.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Nik Patel: So, let me share my screen.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Josh Smith: I mean, I should… I should get an account.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Nik Patel: This is one of the old…

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Nik Patel: Option for priority lines.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Nik Patel: Okay. So…

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Nik Patel: This is the current option. Uh, let's see if I try to export this.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Nik Patel: And if I do download…

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Nik Patel: Goes too fast. Um…

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Nik Patel: Oh, uh, yes.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Nik Patel: Need a bigger… bigger presentation?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Nik Patel: Not this either. Uh…

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Josh Smith: Sorry, I don't know what this is. Does it…

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Josh Smith: I'm guessing this is hard to explain.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Nik Patel: It is hard to explain, but I'll explain it anyway. I'm trying to see, like.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Nik Patel: I know I have seen it…

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna try one more thing, if it works, great, if not, we'll just go to something else.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Nik Patel: Oh, I can do this. And, uh…

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Nik Patel: It's not here. Anyway, um…

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Nik Patel: I'll just tell you what it does. So…

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Josh Smith: Sorry.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Nik Patel: It's all good. It… it worked too fast in this case. In many cases, it did not before.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Nik Patel: But what it is, is, um…

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Nik Patel: it takes the page that I'm trying to export.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Nik Patel: And it will, like, fill it up as if you were filling a water in a pot.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Nik Patel: So it will, like, fill it up, and then the thing that's actually getting exported would start to show slowly but surely.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Nik Patel: So let's say it started with a white blank canvas, and it would fill up a water, and then if, uh, my…

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Nik Patel: let's say it was a Priority Lens logo, I'd see, like, a bit of Priority Lens logo. Then it would fill up more, and it would be, like, wavy fill up.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Nik Patel: And then I'll see half of it, and then 3 thirds…

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Nik Patel: 3, 4th, and then the whole thing.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Nik Patel: But that would tell me that it's actually building the thing, and…

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Nik Patel: Exporting and everything.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Nik Patel: that's one option. So what I was thinking was.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Nik Patel: What if we essentially, instead of doing some countdown.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Nik Patel: In this 5 questions, we'll at least end up taking 10 seconds.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Nik Patel: Right? In a real world, unless someone just says, yes, yes, yes, yes, and that's it.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Nik Patel: In that time, I should have received at least, like.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Nik Patel: 3-4 projects, five, seven contacts, something, and I can start to, like, sprinkle them on the screen.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Nik Patel: If I'm still processing.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Nik Patel: And then once I'm done, it actually starts the process. So it's like, oh, this is my data, it's actually doing something. And it, like, shows, like.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Nik Patel: One name, and then it moves on, and second name it moves on, and third name, and it moves on, stuff like that.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Josh Smith: I see. Okay, so…

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Nik Patel: So instant.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Josh Smith: Sorry.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Nik Patel: it shows the progress, because it's actually moving and showing something that I'm familiar with.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Nik Patel: So it doesn't feel like…

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Nik Patel: Well, okay, seems like it's doing something cool, and that something cool buys me enough time.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Nik Patel: Without needing to do, like, a countdown of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yeah, if you can do that, um…

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Josh Smith: we could.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Josh Smith: You could design different, um.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Josh Smith: Containers, if you want, even, for, like.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Josh Smith: Um… that's down the road, like…

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Josh Smith: like… I wouldn't know what's called. Like, it looks like a document.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Josh Smith: Um, and it has the name… some name on it, and, like, or, like…

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Josh Smith: Something, like, something familiar.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Josh Smith: Be like, oh, okay.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Josh Smith: So there's some experiencing there, okay.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, and let's say we don't want to do any of that right now. Instead of doing 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, we could just simply say.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Nik Patel: scanning emails.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Nik Patel: Scanning meetings, scanning…

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Josh Smith: Mhm.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Nik Patel: blah, scanning blah, scanning blah, that's my 5 seconds.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Nik Patel: Alright, start sharing pictures.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Nik Patel: Or start sharing next screens, I mean.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Josh Smith: Alright, and then, like, successively, it's like, scanning meetings, check.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Josh Smith: Scanning emails, check.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Nik Patel: Yes, something like that.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Josh Smith: Scanning, and it might not be doing it that linearly.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Nik Patel: Exactly.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Josh Smith: But, at least at each loading.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Josh Smith: Percentage or assumption about the time split up, you put the next one in.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Josh Smith: So, yes, because that shows progression in a way that…

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Josh Smith: Doesn't false… like a… like a… like a progress bar.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Josh Smith: Can falsely indicate.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Josh Smith: Whereas this one, it buys you more time progressively, because it's like, alright, that's done.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Josh Smith: Okay, great. Success! I feel good. Next one.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Nik Patel: Night.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Josh Smith: That's done. Success, I feel good, when in reality, it's like.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Nik Patel: It's just a literal animation, it's not actually doing anything.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Gotcha.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Nik Patel: So yeah, I think that probably might be good, because then I don't have to build anything.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Nik Patel: It's just an animation, and…

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Nik Patel: That's about it.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Josh Smith: Scanning coworkers.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Nik Patel: scanning contacts.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Josh Smith: Contacts, thank you.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Nik Patel: People? Yeah.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Um, you believe you can get all this through Gmail alone?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Nik Patel: We'll see? Well, I can still get the emails themselves on an email, right? Like, who sent it, who…

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Nik Patel: who was part of sending it, the names are there, so I can get some stuff, at least in the beginning.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Nik Patel: And then we can say, like, hell, we'll continue to run all the other stuff in the background, let's focus on what's on the top.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Nik Patel: Top of your list.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yeah.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Josh Smith: Frickin'… bubbles.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, every, uh… okay, and if there's ever a moment where you're like, you know what, we do want to give them the opportunity at this moment to…

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Josh Smith: Fill this out with, like.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Josh Smith: Slack integration, or…

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Josh Smith: Compliments, or anything else.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it's the time to do it then, yeah.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Josh Smith: um, whether or not you feel it's the time to do it now, or the time to do it later. If you feel like, no, no, no, like, the magic…

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Josh Smith: We can't give them, like, real value here unless we do, like, a much more broader, longer scan or something.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay, uh, we have these questions. Are these the folks you communicate with the most? Are these the most important projects on your list?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Josh Smith: Kind of like a feedback thing you were talking about before you actually hit the dashboard.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Nik Patel: That's the feedback, yeah. So now we essentially say, because we have done this.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Nik Patel: It's yes and.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Nik Patel: Which is… so if it's yes, great. If it's yes, and…

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Nik Patel: It's basically, I'm gonna add 2 more people to it.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Nik Patel: Right? Um…

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Josh Smith: Got you.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Nik Patel: And then projects. Is this the… are these the important…

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Nik Patel: Projects you are working through.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Nik Patel: Or topics, or… something.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Nik Patel: Maybe, we'll see.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Nik Patel: Yes, and…

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Nik Patel: Or, yes, move on.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Nik Patel: Or simply, like…

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Nik Patel: Yes, more.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Nik Patel: Next, whatever. Or, next, I guess, is not needed, so…

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Nik Patel: Yes, add more.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Josh Smith: Okay, and the act of adding more, is it a continued dialogue with the…

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Josh Smith: Uh, okay, so it, it just…

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, just okay, okay, tell me more. I'm gonna make a note of that, and we just move them to the next one ourselves.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Gotta make a note of that.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Josh Smith: That's the yes and.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Josh Smith: So this is the feedback to know that you've gotten everything.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, and then there's the reveal of the dashboard.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Josh Smith: Once they hit you… sorry, you were gonna say something?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Nik Patel: Um… not on this one, I think this one's good.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Nik Patel: I was gonna say, what do you think of this process? Is this too long before they actually see the value, or is this…

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Josh Smith: I think it's fine for voice.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Josh Smith: It's my gut.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Nik Patel: We'll see. Yeah, I feel it too, but I guess once we see it in action, we can say, like, oh yeah, we feel good about it, or we don't, and we gotta figure…

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Nik Patel: Slow it down, or pass-forward it, or something.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Josh Smith: Linda?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, there's so many dimensions in the market segment, the most common times at which they would do this, um, the assumptions about whether they would do it on mobile or on the desktop.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Josh Smith: Um, and, um…

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Josh Smith: But I'm definitely an advocate here of, yeah, this is, um…

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Josh Smith: This is the… this is…

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Josh Smith: An optimal way to do it.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Josh Smith: Because I have… there is a contract I'm on, and I keep telling them.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Josh Smith: They need to go to voice, because…

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Josh Smith: They're trying to…

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Josh Smith: It creates, um, exercises of dialogue.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Josh Smith: Only by typing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Josh Smith: To get that information.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Nik Patel: That could… that could be.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Josh Smith: And I'm just like…

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Josh Smith: They're getting feedback that it is…

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Josh Smith: Exhausting, and it's… it's homework.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Josh Smith: And you don't want to design this to make it feel like homework.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Josh Smith: Because you're trying to get… take away the work.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Nik Patel: That actually reminded me, something we could do that could actually be tricky, uh, fun too.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Nik Patel: So, where it says, preparing your experience now.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Nik Patel: That could actually come at the end, after they have selected this three things.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh, because you could get these earlier.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Nik Patel: But the hurt there can be…

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Nik Patel: Based on what you have told us, uh, here's the type of personality you are.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Nik Patel: Right? And it's like, oh, okay, I can just say it, or I can read it out.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Nik Patel: So now, let's go through some…

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Nik Patel: Prioritization, or whatever, and then…

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Nik Patel: At the end, the scanning email's done, yada yada yada, and then you straight up land on the dashboard.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Josh Smith: Okay. So, based on… based on what you have told us, here's the type of personality we believe you are.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Josh Smith: Is this accurate?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Josh Smith: Yes.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Josh Smith: And, um…

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Nik Patel: Would you agree? And just yes.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Josh Smith: Would you agree?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Nik Patel: Actually, no, then what did they say now?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Josh Smith: Uh…

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Josh Smith: Would… would you agree?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Josh Smith: Yes, almost there, no. Well, this is one of those, like, did you want to… did you want to do another one of these, um…

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Josh Smith: dialogues, again.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Josh Smith: Uh, tell me more, what am I missing about you?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Josh Smith: Or…

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Josh Smith: What are your thoughts about that?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that works. Tell me more, and then it goes straight into…

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Josh Smith: Alright, these are the folks you communicate with the most.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Nik Patel: So based on… based on looking at your calendar, or meetings, emails.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Nik Patel: and communications, um…

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Nik Patel: We think these are the people you communicate with the most.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Nik Patel: And then… can you confirm? Yes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Nik Patel: Yes, and, um…

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Nik Patel: Great. These are the most important topic on your… based on your…

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Nik Patel: Email history… is that accurate?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes, and, um…

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Nik Patel: Fantastic. Um…

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Nik Patel: We are preparing the personalized experience for you, scanning done, email done, contact done, here's the dashboard.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Nik Patel: And if I… if I do my job right, we might not need that scanning done thing at all.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Nik Patel: That's the goal at List.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Josh Smith: Your ideal… oh, so the ideal state is to be done by the end of this.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Josh Smith: So this is almost just like your fallback.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Nik Patel: It's a placeholder, worst-case scenario.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Nik Patel: Fallback, yeah.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Josh Smith: They're, um…

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Josh Smith: They're in the Sahara.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Josh Smith: And Wi-Fi is spotty.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Nik Patel: It's bad, yeah, bad, bad, bad, yeah.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Okay.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Josh Smith: dashboard, uh…

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Josh Smith: I like, uh, I like reveals, so, like, with…

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Josh Smith: with Dashboard, um…

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Josh Smith: You know, even if it's like, uh, we prepared the dashboard for you, here it comes, and like.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Josh Smith: The white… the white screen breaks.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Josh Smith: off. And…

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Josh Smith: It's underneath of it.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Josh Smith: It's like opening a present.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Nik Patel: Interesting. Yeah, I like that, the animations of it.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Josh Smith: Um… those… the feeling… use of animation to feel like, oh, okay, it's like…

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Josh Smith: It went from white to, like…

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Josh Smith: The pieces coming off, and you seeing under… every… like, opening the hood and seeing, okay, this is…

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, those are, like, fun little micro interactions.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so I think that gets us to the dashboard.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Nik Patel: And then we need to figure out what actually do we do on the dashboard now.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Josh Smith: And I know… and I know that was part of the meeting today we wanted to get to, like.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Nik Patel: the hard part.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Nik Patel: It's all good. I think this is helpful.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, okay, and that'll probably be a longer conversation, because…

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Josh Smith: There's a part of my mind that needs to kind of reorient around.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Josh Smith: what this AI could do, because…

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Josh Smith: I'm used to operating in terms of task flows, so, like.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Josh Smith: It knows a project…

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Josh Smith: It knows the deadline.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Josh Smith: It knows you had just communicated with someone, has a history of that thread.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Josh Smith: That someone's looking for an answer.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Josh Smith: And… it's saying…

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Josh Smith: Hey, for this project, um…

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Josh Smith: We have enough information to respond. Here's…

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Josh Smith: here's a… based on your communication style, here's how we'd respond. Would you agree?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Josh Smith: Yes or no? Sure.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Josh Smith: Like…

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Josh Smith: I…

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Josh Smith: And I asked, like, well, let's have 3, but at the same time.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Josh Smith: Are there so many permutations of what could happen?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Josh Smith: that… ins…

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Josh Smith: that I need to treat these scenarios.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Josh Smith: I need to, like, um…

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Josh Smith: Treat these scenarios as shells.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Josh Smith: Because the content is going to constantly change.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Josh Smith: And if they are shells, how do, how do, um…

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Josh Smith: What's the structure of those shells, like.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Josh Smith: There's an email. There's an email.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Josh Smith: uh, response shell.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Nik Patel: Right.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Josh Smith: there's, like, what, like, task… I'm calling it task shells.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Josh Smith: But are there specific kind of task shells that.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Josh Smith: We need to design for.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Josh Smith: to say it's…

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Josh Smith: These are, of all the tasks, here's how we would classify the tasks.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Josh Smith: And here's the shell for each of those tasks.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Josh Smith: Here's the structure within theirs. Each task shell has.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Josh Smith: The task name, the task description.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Nik Patel: Something, yeah.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Josh Smith: and buttons.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Josh Smith: Um, that kind of stuff.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I think that's the right way to look at it, for sure.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Nik Patel: Gum.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, like, an email shell is just email thread, right? Like, there is a person.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Nik Patel: There is a thing that they said, and it's, like.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Nik Patel: everything that others said is here. What I say is on the right-hand side.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Nik Patel: And when I write my stuff and hit send.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Nik Patel: It goes up, like, this is unread, this is red, stuff like that.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Would… would you like to meet next… is it too late, or just on time to meet next Thursday?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Josh Smith: To start defining those shells.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Nik Patel: Whenever you tell me, yeah, I'll be… I'll be around.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Josh Smith: Alright, let's do Thursday.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Um…

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Josh Smith: Or Friday.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Nik Patel: No, that's fine. The earlier the better, because that gives me some time over…

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Nik Patel: End part of the month to be able to push some stuff out, or start to develop some of the stuff.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Nik Patel: For now, I'm gonna look into building what we talked about here.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Nik Patel: And see how far I can get with it.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Josh Smith: Um, the only thing we didn't talk about with this is…

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Josh Smith: preferred voice, but I assume with whatever framework you're using.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Nik Patel: Yes, um…

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Nik Patel: I'm thinking about using 11 Labs right now, I just need to see…

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Nik Patel: Elon Labs in general is pretty good.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Nik Patel: Google, or OpenAI's voice API is pretty good, too.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Nik Patel: Gemini is getting pretty good, I just don't know how good it is in actual responses.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Nik Patel: All to say, I… yeah, I'll think through that on…

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Nik Patel: In the beginning, do we even give them voice options, or do we just say, like… do we just start talking, you know?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Nik Patel: Like, for example.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Nik Patel: Syrian… well, I don't know if they do it now.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Nik Patel: But Siri never did anything, right? Like, CD is a CD, it's the same sound no matter what.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Nik Patel: But then ChatGPT gives you, like, oh, if you talk like this person, it's an, uh…

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Nik Patel: charismatic energy person, and this is more analytical person, and their response and stuff like that.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Nik Patel: I don't know how Eleven Labs work enough, or for that matter, any of those, to be able to say if we can do that up front.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Josh Smith: You know what would be fun, although this is just out there.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Josh Smith: To be able to… if we knew exactly what this kind of personality was, and we had data on what kind of…

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Josh Smith: Voice appeals the most to common types of personality.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Josh Smith: To not even give them an option, but just kind of, like, shift it on them.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Josh Smith: As… as they're going?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I like that.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Josh Smith: Um… so…

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Josh Smith: Um, anyway. Um, was this… was this time valuable?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Nik Patel: Oh, absolutely loved it.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Nik Patel: It feels like a lot I've been thinking about is coming on paper, which is amazing.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Nik Patel: I… I know it's different than what we had talked about, but I definitely see this as way more valuable.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Nik Patel: All the structure that you have, uh, going in on the…

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Nik Patel: Strategy, structure, the left-hand side of it, project, topic, all of that.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Nik Patel: I think that would be a good…

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Nik Patel: Design guidelines by which we… we ask a…

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Nik Patel: AI to develop things for me anyway.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Nik Patel: So, I want to start, like, thinking about those structures more and more. And once we have design guidelines, once we agree on something as, like, a framework, a lot of those components are in place, and now we are starting to think about logic and experience and data and all that.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Nik Patel: Which, sooner we get there, the better.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Nik Patel: The only thing that I would ask is, are you completely out of pocket, or if I send you messages.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Nik Patel: Let me ask this, is it okay to send messages over the weekend in the first place?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Josh Smith: Hey, text me whenever you want.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um…

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Josh Smith: Okay, fully open to text, yeah.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Nik Patel: Okay, um, cause if I'm… I'm definitely gonna be working on this this weekend.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Nik Patel: I want to see if I can at least get it far enough where I get, like.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Nik Patel: The voice portion of it working to an extent.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Nik Patel: Uh, even if it's just simply, what should I call you? Call me Nick, okay, I'll call you Nick, even if I get that far.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Nik Patel: I think that's a good progress, so I want to see how far I can push it.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Nik Patel: Oh, that reminds me, um…

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Nik Patel: I think you were doing this somewhere?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Nik Patel: I saw the Priority Lens logo looks a little bit different. Is that something that you picked, or is that something you think we should use?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Josh Smith: Oh, I just…

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Nik Patel: I'll use something… okay.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Josh Smith: I just… I just stubbed in something.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Nik Patel: That's fine. Um…

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Nik Patel: Is there a… color…

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Nik Patel: branding type of guideline that I can get out of this, or…

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Nik Patel: Should I just build with anything, and then we'll figure out the colors later?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Josh Smith: Build with anything, we'll figure the colors out later.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that's fine.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Nik Patel: I'll just use shared CN components by default, and…

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Nik Patel: we can just themeify them later. There are ways to just, like, themeify them.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Nik Patel: on their own.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Color is, like…

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Josh Smith: Um, we, like…

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Josh Smith: There's so many weeds of cult, like, colors…

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Josh Smith: Color theory is so complex.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Josh Smith: that I'd rather…

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Josh Smith: And I'm so prone to wanting to teach on color theory.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Josh Smith: that I have to stop myself and be like.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Josh Smith: Do whatever you want.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Josh Smith: I will recommend the changes afterwards.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Okay.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Josh Smith: Um, if you are…

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Josh Smith: If you have an affinity for a specific color.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Josh Smith: Let me know early.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Nik Patel: Um… did I send you the brand? Oh, I think I did, right? Did I send you the actual brand?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Nik Patel: style guide that Paula put together for us.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Josh Smith: No?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Nik Patel: That's my bad, then. Um…

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Josh Smith: No, I don't even think I have the logo.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Josh Smith: So, unless… see, I'm sorry, I'm also absent-minded, so I…

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Josh Smith: Let me look on the main website, the… the…

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Josh Smith: The prototype you built? No, okay, it's not on there.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Nik Patel: No, it's not there, for sure.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Nik Patel: So, take a look at this portion.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Nik Patel: So, Paula had sent me this Canva.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Nik Patel: And I'm going to download this as well.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna share my screen, hoping it works this time.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, sure.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Nik Patel: So let me just get this into PDF first.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Nik Patel: And then… so, she had put together…

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Nik Patel: Like, some branding on how…

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Nik Patel: How we think… how we should talk about things.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Nik Patel: And here's the, uh, palette that we had ended up picking.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Nik Patel: But there are, like, other OP… wow, I think she removed them. Yeah, she did.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Nik Patel: So that's the palette we had ended up choosing.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Nik Patel: This one.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Nik Patel: Right or wrong, we'll fix it later, but…

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Nik Patel: That's what felt right at that time, so…

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Nik Patel: Come on, doesn't do it.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Nik Patel: Uh, anyway, um, I… let me share this with you.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Josh Smith: Um, I'll read through the deck, because that'll help me understand the decisions.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Josh Smith: Uh, that is a very… the… those colors are safe, are very safe colors.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Nik Patel: Yep, and we could, we could, again, change it to anything later, I just needed something so I could start working.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Nik Patel: So I'm not too worried about it.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and, um…

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Josh Smith: I might expand on that. So, uh, break it out into…

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Josh Smith: Um, there's brand colors, but then there's, like, product, uh, your product palette, which will take, you know.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Josh Smith: We'll split out your hues from 900 down to 100 in tints and shades.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Josh Smith: With your primary being somewhere in the middle, like 500.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Josh Smith: You've probably seen those.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you're gonna need those… you're not gonna need all of them, but you're gonna need that kind of flexibility as you design.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yep.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Josh Smith: Um, so you're… we're gonna need to split those out for use, and yeah, you can start with…

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Josh Smith: You can start with a primary, secondary, tertiary, and then.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Josh Smith: adjust as you want. You could even programmatically create that scale, 900 to 100.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Nik Patel: Yes. Yep.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Josh Smith: with, like, fixed saturation and lightness and hue, or, I mean, sorry, fixed hue and saturation and variable lightness.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Josh Smith: For your tints and shades, so that…

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Josh Smith: You can just adjust a hue value in one place and shift the color everywhere.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Josh Smith: Later. You're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Josh.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Nik Patel: No, no, no, those are the things I have seen, and those are the parts that I don't know how to even do in the first place, so…

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. Mhm.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Nik Patel: My… I think if we can work through that, um, that would be great.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Nik Patel: And then, um…

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Nik Patel: I, I want to, uh… oh, that reminds me.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, we haven't signed anything, and I don't know if we want to, it's up to you.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Nik Patel: I know that you had said 50%.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Nik Patel: up front, what is the best way to pay you, or is that something you just want to do in one shot? I'm fine either way, again, uh, just want to make sure you had said that, and…

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Nik Patel: To be mindful of it.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Josh Smith: No…

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Josh Smith: I'm so bad at this, too, um…

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Nik Patel: I'm really bad at it, too, like…

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Josh Smith: Let's…

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Nik Patel: I have not done my expenses since May for one of my customers, and it's like, you…

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Josh Smith: Alright, well, if we're… if we're both bad at this, how about we just continue this arrangement?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Nik Patel: They're okay with it, but, like…

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Josh Smith: Sit… Get into a weekly…

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Josh Smith: Meeting on a weekly rhythm.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Josh Smith: Where you feel like you're…

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Josh Smith: You're getting value out of me that you've expected.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Josh Smith: And once you get in that place, and you feel like you have… you've made progress, and you feel like.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Josh Smith: You feel confident that progress is leading to completion.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Josh Smith: Uh, then…

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Josh Smith: At that point, um…

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Josh Smith: I'll send along something to sign, and we can do the 50%.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Nik Patel: Okay, yeah, let me… you let me know when you're ready, I'm fine either way, yeah.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Josh Smith: Okay. It's either that, or will one swell foop it at the end when you feel like the arrangement's over?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Nik Patel: Oscar.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Nik Patel: Yep, yeah.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Josh Smith: I'm fine with that, too.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Nik Patel: That works. I'm basically expecting that I will pay you in December. That's my goal, right? Like, we will be done, hopefully, in December anyway, one way or the other, so I'm hoping that I'll pay you in December. That's…

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Josh Smith: Let's do end of December. Additionally, I'm off the entire last week of December for my other contracts.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Josh Smith: if… I leave that open. If you feel like during our arrangement you need…

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Josh Smith: You need to do a final push where we need to meet more often.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Nik Patel: Mhm.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Josh Smith: I'll leave that last week of the year open.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Nik Patel: Yes, let's plan for that. I'll take that time.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay, sure.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, great, awesome. Thanks, Josh.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, good, thank you.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Nik Patel: Have a good weekend. See ya.
