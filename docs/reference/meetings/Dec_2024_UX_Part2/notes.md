## Key Insight on Burnout

> "When work feels like we are actually winning, hard work doesn't lead to burnout - you're passionate and you would push. Obviously, you gotta take care of health and family relations. But when it feels like bureaucracy, things are not going well, you are just spinning wheels, your work's not appreciated - that's what ends up leading to burnout."

### Nik's Personal Example

**This year (2024/2025):** Pushing hard but energized
> "This year has been exactly that. Been pushing so hard. And yet, I'm ever-energized, and it's like, oh, this is the time, I'm having fun, let's do it."

**Last year:** Startup burnout
- Co-founder with different business approaches
- Company not going in right direction
- Sales not coming, growth stagnating
- 3 layoffs in 1.5 years
- Team went from 80 engineers to 12
- Having to tell engineers "you did a great job, but sorry" every 6 months

> "A lot of that led to burnout, but it wasn't because I was working hard. I'm still working hard now, and it feels fun."

### Josh's Perspective
> "As long as I've got healthy relationships and there's no toxic environments or people, it's harder for me to recognize burnout with the work itself. The work is easy. People are what stress me out."

## Recording & Privacy Practices

### CCPA/Privacy Context
Nik's California client:
- Highly regulated industry
- Can't record meetings without senior director approval
- When meeting ends, all Copilot notes disappear
- Have to capture notes before dropping the meeting

**Story:** 4-hour GenAI workshop where they forgot to announce recording
> "The director was like, I know we recorded the call, but we should have let everyone know. Now I have to go back and ask everyone, and if they don't want it, I have to cut out their voice."

### Soul-Sucking Contract Example
Josh's billionaire client:
- B2C survey app with financial firm-level security
- Spending "whole bunch of time" on CCPA compliance
- Not even close to 50,000 California users threshold
- Building huge infrastructure for compliance they don't need yet

## Product Naming Discussion

### The Dilemma
- Company: Priority Lens (keeping this)
- Product name: TBD
- Assistant name: Lenso? Lance? Lens?

### The Challenge
> "I like the idea of having the assistant name being the product name. But it's gonna be really hard to find an assistant name that doesn't have .AI already taken up."

### Josh's Input
> "If you name your product Cortex AI, that sounds like a name, so you could say 'Hi, I'm Cortex.' If you name your product Priority Lens, you probably want to choose 'Hi, I'm Lens' or 'Hi, I'm Lance' - something more human."

## UX Wireframing Session

### Auth Flow (Quick)
Josh wireframed:
1. Sign in screen with Google button
2. Google OAuth access screen
3. Two-factor authentication

Nik noted these will likely come from auth provider anyway.

### Voice Mode Permission
Discussion on microphone permissions:
- On phone, it's just one microphone (no selection needed)
- Decided to prompt users before asking for permission
- "Would you want a guided onboarding?" or "Do you want to try voice mode?"

### Frontline Connection
Both worked at Frontline Education:
- Josh: 2014-2019 (before Nik)
- Nik: 2016 onward (joined Aplitrack team)
- Thoma Bravo acquired, then sold to Roper Technologies
- Company going through RIFs "like crazy"

## Key Quotes

On burnout source:
> "Going to engineers as a leader in front of them and saying 'hey, you did a great job, but sorry' and then doing that every 6 months just continues to add up."

On relationship quality:
> Josh: "People are what stress me out."
> Nik: "Yeah, people are good." [referring to current projects]

On over-engineering:
> Josh: "Y'all, you know there's thresholds that you are not gonna meet for many, many years."
> [About CCPA compliance for early-stage startup]
