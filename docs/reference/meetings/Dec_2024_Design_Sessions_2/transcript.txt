00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Nik Patel: How are you feeling?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Josh Smith: Better, thanks.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Nik Patel: Ah, you still sound bad.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, uh…

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, it got worse and worse and worse, and then I was like, well.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Josh Smith: It's not viral.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Nik Patel: Oh.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Josh Smith: Uh, it…

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Josh Smith: Gotta be bacterial if it gets, if it's not getting any better, so I went to the doctor, they confirmed it, and they put me on antibiotics, so I'm like, okay.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Josh Smith: As long as we got a solution, I'm okay.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, well, good.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Nik Patel: Good. Um…

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Nik Patel: All right, uh, yeah, if you feel like at any point it's time to pause, I'm completely okay with it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, all good, let's jump right in.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Nik Patel: Alright, uh, do you mind if I record the call?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Josh Smith: I do not mind.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Nik Patel: Right. Alright, we are recording.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Josh Smith: Anything I say or do…

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Josh Smith: can be used against me in the court of Nick.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Nik Patel: hopefully this also helps us, uh, just… I've been using this…

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Nik Patel: when I do these meetings, um…

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Nik Patel: I get transcript and I'm fitting transcript straight into Cloud Code to be able to figure out like.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Nik Patel: decisions that we are making when we go through requirements gathering. I haven't done it here, but I tried that on a project, and it worked out really, really well, so I'm looking forward to, uh, seeing if I can reuse it here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Josh Smith: Great.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Nik Patel: Right, um…

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Nik Patel: Let's see, did you have a chance to look at that Google AI Studio thing?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Josh Smith: I'm looking at it right now.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Josh Smith: Google AI Studio, I was… I spent some time trying to figure out what… how this even works, Google AI Studio.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Nik Patel: Oh.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Josh Smith: But I'm like, okay.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Nik Patel: I can show you, for what it's worth, I could show you what it's supposed to do, um…

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Nik Patel: That helps.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Josh Smith: Meet Lenzo, I'll ask you a few questions, click below to ask. Yeah, go for it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Josh Smith: Now it's allow… now it's actually… is this actual live code?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Nik Patel: Well, yeah, so, uh, Studio does it, where it's, like, within that, where I could actually test it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nik Patel: And it's connected to Gemini using my API key and all that?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Josh Smith: Hi, I'm Lenzo. I'm here to calibrate your experience.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Josh Smith: Oh, sorry, it's going on right now, uh, you should… you should call me…

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Josh Smith: Josh.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Josh Smith: Thanks, Josh! How would you prefer that I communicate with you? For example, do you want me to be direct and concise, or more conversational and detailed?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Josh Smith: I'll just be real concise and straight to the point. If I want details, I'll ask for it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Josh Smith: Got it. Finally, what are the top 3 things you need to focus on right now?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Josh Smith: Well, I'm working on this thing with this dude named Nick.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Josh Smith: Spelled NIK because he's gotta be like so different from everyone.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Josh Smith: And… Can you spell…

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Josh Smith: Uh-oh, now I'm breaking it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Josh Smith: Can you specify the 3 key tasks we need to focus on right now?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'm gonna stop this so we can chat.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Josh Smith: Alright, I'll do that later.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Nik Patel: Okay. Well, that's all it is. So, like, once you answer that, it will tell you, here's what your profile looks like, and that's about it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Nik Patel: I haven't gone to, like, much detail, haven't gone through, like, all the exact questions we had talked about and everything.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Nik Patel: I just really wanted to see if I could create that UI where, like, you see Lenso speaking, and it shows that.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Josh Smith: Dude, you did it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, you see… it, um, I think the orb can be a little bit better, but…

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Nik Patel: I like that the conversation that, like, shows up at the bottom just, like, gives a good feeling, so that screen I like in general.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. No, I think you accomplished it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Nik Patel: Okay, good. And for what it's worth, I didn't write single line of code. This was actually, like, 2 in the morning.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Nik Patel: Um, I was, uh… I can actually show you what it looked like. There was, like, a bunch of fighting at the end, but…

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Josh Smith: No way.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Josh Smith: Take…

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Josh Smith: Take care of yourself.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Nik Patel: Here. I just couldn't sleep. I slept, like, at 8 and.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Nik Patel: Just woke up and couldn't go back to sleep.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Nik Patel: So, anyway, um, what it is, it's literally, like, this prompt.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Nik Patel: Right? Uh, from there on, it just built some code, then we went on to, like, fixing some stuff on, like, hey, fix this, fix that, fix it here, fix it there, type of thing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Nik Patel: Um, like, some connection issues and whatnot. So, like, a bunch of that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Nik Patel: Um, then I tasted it, and I essentially said, here's what I saw that we need to update. It went on doing things, some more back and forth, some more back and forth, and we essentially ended here.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. Very, holy moly, the future is here.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, the, the main… I think the main feedback I have on that one is it was…

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Josh Smith: You heard it was like totally interrupting me while I was talking, um, and that's one of those. We've talked about it, it was like.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Josh Smith: That kills me and if, like, so, like, it's one of those, I'd rather for me and I can't speak for your market.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Josh Smith: For me, though, I would rather just be like.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Josh Smith: When you're done, say, I'm done, or tap the I'm done button. Okay, thank you. Now I can just go on a rant.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Josh Smith: And watch you transcribe what I'm saying.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Josh Smith: I can say, okay, I'm done.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Josh Smith: Um… so that it doesn't freaking interrupt me.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Nik Patel: Yes, yes. I did put, like, a one-second delay on it, or two-second delay on it or something, but yes, I'm with you. I see that happen as well, especially if you're, like.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Nik Patel: Thinking on the third thing. Um, sometimes it gets the name wrong, so I need to fix that too.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Nik Patel: Especially, like, Josh is probably a very common name, and it's trained on that, so…

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Nik Patel: it got it right. Like, Nick, it would always go in NICK, because that's common.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Nik Patel: Uh, for my wife, um…

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Nik Patel: It always spelled it wrong, no matter what.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Nik Patel: So, even if you, like, spell it out for it, it was like, yeah, okay, Ankit, and it's like, there is no T at the end, it's Anki, you know?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Nik Patel: So, um… but I think that's an easy one to solve, because once they…

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Nik Patel: login for real. I'm gonna get the profile name from their user profile, and we will start with that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Nik Patel: I have captured your name as that, is that what you want me to call you? And if they say yes, great, and then just move on, you know?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Nik Patel: So I think there are some answers to that, but overall, the waveform, I think, is working out good. In general, that screen, I think, feels more natural at this point.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Nik Patel: Um, so we can convert that into some more design updates to be done, but overall, the waveform itself is working, which feels pretty good.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Josh Smith: Awesome. Um…

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Josh Smith: And then, and then, uh, another detail, just have to test whether or not showing them…

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Josh Smith: Well, showing them what they're saying.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Nik Patel: So… I'm going back and forth on that. Right now, I'm showing it, right? So, like, it actually is…

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Nik Patel: in a way, it's good, but at the same time, because of my accent, sometimes it actually thinks that I'm talking in a different language, and.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Nik Patel: It's not getting the name right, even though conversationally, audio-wise, it's working out.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Nik Patel: Um, so I just need to think through, like.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Nik Patel: is it gonna create a distraction that's worth it or not worth it? And I don't know one way or the other yet.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Nik Patel: The good thing is, because it's Gemini's voice, um, you could talk to it in any language, and it understands that language.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Josh Smith: Oh my…

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Nik Patel: So I asked it, like, hey, let's talk in Gujarati and Hindi, like, all those Indian languages that I know.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Nik Patel: And it does start talking in that language just fine.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Nik Patel: So, anyway.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Josh Smith: Well, how do you feel about it?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Nik Patel: Um, I think it's, like, 50-60% there. There's a lot to be improved upon.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Josh Smith: So far.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Nik Patel: I'm talking specifically the screen, everything else is just there for the sake of it, but…

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Nik Patel: What I like, I like the waveform, I like that I, um… and I did this after the fact, but I like that I have, like, two different waveforms. One is for user speaking, and one is for lens of speaking.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Nik Patel: And we can see that user speaking is capturing me, and Lance is speaking as I'm listening.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Nik Patel: So I like that transition in general. The orb can be a little bit better. Right now, at least it flashes, so I know it's working and I know it's speaking and stuff.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Nik Patel: Um… that design could be a little bit better. The…

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Nik Patel: Uh, transcript is…

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Nik Patel: I think where it is is pretty good, but it only captures, like, a very minute piece of it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Nik Patel: Which I'm thinking, like, if there is a better way to show that. So, again, like, some more UI elements to be moved around, and…

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Nik Patel: Designed to be refined, but overall.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Nik Patel: I think once we add more questions, this will be…

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Nik Patel: this will be pretty good, like, just you even talking with it probably took, like, 20 seconds or so, so I know I'm getting the time that I was expecting, and that portion worked out really well, without feeling like…

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Nik Patel: You are going through onboarding, you are going through onboarding.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Nik Patel: So that worked out pretty good. That's just my assessment so far.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Nik Patel: What do you think?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you know, again, I can't speak for the market, but I… I… I like it, and I prefer it over typing out.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, I would rather… I would rather talk to a computer all day to get my stuff done.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, me too. I'm getting into that habit too, actually. With Whisperflow, I'm just doing a lot of talking.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Nik Patel: And it's more natural, too, because I can think faster, I can talk faster than I can type.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, for a productivity app, that's worth it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Josh Smith: my speaking language…

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, the way I speak is completely different from the way I type.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Josh Smith: Some people say I'm, like, a different person. I'm, like, much, much more…

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Josh Smith: serious, when I type.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Nik Patel: Or in typing?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and uh…

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, it's… I look forward to the day when…

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Josh Smith: My computer can just say, hey, hey, you got an… you got an email from this vendor asking you for an update, and I can just be like.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, can you just connect with Hannah?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Josh Smith: And ask her to send me a.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Josh Smith: like, XYZ, um, let me know when I get it, and um…

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Josh Smith: I'd like to review it, um, and uh… I'll let you know if it's good or not, so you can forward that over the vendor.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, sure, you know, like…

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Josh Smith: That's what I want to do.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Josh Smith: That takes like… again, that takes, like, less than a minute for me to do, but for me to coordinate all of that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Josh Smith: On the computer takes…

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it's a much different bandwidth, yeah.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Josh Smith: It's much time.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Nik Patel: Makes sense.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Nik Patel: Well, I can't wait for the day when it, uh, it knows what I'm thinking and, well, when I want it to know, and then just, like, just talk.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Nik Patel: done with it. Um…

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Josh Smith: You mean, translate thoughts?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Nik Patel: And then…

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that's… that's my…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Nik Patel: I'm a big proponent of brain-computer interfaces. It's very infancy right now, but I know it will get there at some point, so we'll just wait for someone else to build it right now, because I don't have bandwidth.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, um, I am too.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Josh Smith: Uh, I'm totally cool with it. I know some people, like, freaks them out. I'm like.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Josh Smith: I'm just like, how do we get there…

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Josh Smith: Who's gonna be the first.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Josh Smith: Testers, you know.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Nik Patel: So, Neuralink does it, but all of them that do it today is more invasive, like, you have to do, uh, skull, you have to break into your skull in a way.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Nik Patel: Meta's fair research, um, essentially built it so that.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Nik Patel: they are using fMRI, which are super expensive, but as you are typing.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Nik Patel: you're also thinking about some stuff, right? And they use the MRI to figure out what you're thinking as you're typing.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Nik Patel: And it's a really good…

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Nik Patel: like, precise thing, but fMRI are super expensive, not consumer grade right now.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Josh Smith: It'll get there, though.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Nik Patel: So, we'll get there, yep.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Josh Smith: It'll get there… I'm… I'm so… sorry.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Josh Smith: Of course, go for it!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Nik Patel: Alright, sorry about that, uh, I'm with you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Nik Patel: Uh, you're muted.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Josh Smith: I was… oh, I said all good.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Josh Smith: Thanks. The one thing I, uh, don't know about the brain stuff is…

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Nik Patel: Great.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Josh Smith: The commonality. Like, maybe you know this, if I think, like, banana.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Nik Patel: Oh.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Josh Smith: Is the way my brain mapping that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Josh Smith: Completely different from another person's brain in a way that there's, like, absolutely no way.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Josh Smith: you can…

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Josh Smith: calibrate universally? Like, is it, like, so unique that you can only calibrate to a person's individual brain?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Josh Smith: Or can you, like, can you figure out.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Josh Smith: The brain, generally, and how banana gets interpreted.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Josh Smith: Across all humans, like…

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Nik Patel: No idea. I think the linguistic difference might be, uh, might play a role there as well.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Nik Patel: What they are trying to do right now is they're using, like, neural…

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Nik Patel: Waves to be able to figure out what… what you are typing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Nik Patel: And what you're thinking are, like, matching up or not, because generally they do match up when you're typing and writing.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Nik Patel: Um, all to say, I think it's made some great progress.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Nik Patel: to your point, is there a way to do that? Yeah, there are ways to, like.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Nik Patel: do a training on it, so I had built this software.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Nik Patel: 4 years ago, maybe, uh, using, um, EEG, where you would, like.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Nik Patel: See a cube on your screen, and then it will ask you to think, to say, like, go right, go left, go up, go down.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Nik Patel: And you would think that, and then it would capture that.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Nik Patel: Um, and then…

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Nik Patel: Um, it says, okay, you have trained it, and then you just start thinking, and it will start moving around.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Nik Patel: So that portion itself is not that hard.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Josh Smith: That.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Josh Smith: Oh, look at the little guy!

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, he just barged into the room, and…

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Josh Smith: Oh, he's so excited.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Josh Smith: That's cool, so the… so the mouse… the mouse brain with precision…

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Josh Smith: Is something that is… might be nearer.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, it's pretty close already. Um, I have used it, I have EEG device sitting somewhere at home.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Nik Patel: So, I had started learning neuroscience for fun, just to understand how some of this works.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Nik Patel: But then got pulled into…

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Nik Patel: some other stuff, so I haven't had a chance to, like, go too deep.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Nik Patel: Someday, though. And, um, so Meta came out with their wristband, and there are quite a few companies are coming out with it, where you just wear this wristband, and then you, like.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Nik Patel: Do some gestures, and it will actually move all the other stuff.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Nik Patel: Uh, on your screen, just because it would take the…

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Nik Patel: Uh, take your…

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Nik Patel: Gestures, muscles moving, and things like that, um, and use that as a gesture on, like, you are trying to do something, so…

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Nik Patel: Like, if you do tap-tap, right, it moves the muscle in a certain way, and they'll know that you're doing a tap, or you're doing a swipe, or you're doing up or down, and stuff like that. So that, they already come out commercially. I think.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Nik Patel: Sometime this year, and recently a couple more companies came out too, so that's happening.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Nik Patel: For sure.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Josh Smith: That's cool.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Nik Patel: Awesome. Alright, so, um…

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Nik Patel: Where do we go today?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Josh Smith: A couple things…

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Josh Smith: Let me bring up the Figma.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Josh Smith: Do you want to talk first about… so, uh…

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Josh Smith: Well, we talked about Friday, I'm gonna review that first.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Josh Smith: And then, um…

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Josh Smith: Provide some options, um…

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Josh Smith: Oh yeah, there you are. Oh, hi! Um…

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Josh Smith: Alright, uh…

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Josh Smith: You talked about a rule when an email comes in, check it and reply tag, you spoke about the agent. If you get an incoming email from a prospect, any information, manage the conversation, gather information online, and so you get that information provided to me for the brief.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Josh Smith: The idea of a rule versus an agent, we talked about how they could potentially be the same thing to the user, one's simple, one's complex.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Josh Smith: You talked about the need of how do we articulate the clear value of the.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Josh Smith: How do we articulate the clear value of this product in our, I guess, our marketing branding?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Josh Smith: Um, we talked about a couple features, uh, daily weekly summary.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Josh Smith: 5 minutes start of the week or end of the week.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Josh Smith: Um, conversation?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Josh Smith: Um, with AI, um…

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Josh Smith: Uh, how to manage multiple emails and calendars. We talked about a future idea, marketplace for agents built by customers, um…

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Josh Smith: And, um, how we can, the principles.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Josh Smith: Call them Principles of design, um…

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Josh Smith: Um, designing for perception of privacy.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Josh Smith: These are just guiding principles for me, and how the product should speak for itself.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Josh Smith: Outside of that, I'm going to put in, uh, the, um, moving forward.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Josh Smith: the, um…

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Josh Smith: You know, uh, what does… what does the landing experience look like?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Josh Smith: Of course, once you go through onboarding.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Josh Smith: And then, um… the other thing is something you sent me earlier last week, which was, um…

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Josh Smith: Thoughts on the elevator pitch?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Josh Smith: And, uh, you called the other thing the tagline…

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Josh Smith: And no, you didn't call anything, but the, um…

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Josh Smith: I'll call it the tagline. Ah, yeah.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Josh Smith: logline, tagline… it's not a tagline, really, I'll call it the log line, but that's…

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Josh Smith: screenplay, uh…

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Josh Smith: language. Um…

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Josh Smith: Of these two right here.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Josh Smith: This one is, uh, you know, UX Next Steps.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Josh Smith: And this one is…

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Josh Smith: You know, marketing, which…

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Josh Smith: Which one of those would you like to discuss today?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Josh Smith: And if neither, what would you like to discuss?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Nik Patel: I think UX, um, we need to start…

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Nik Patel: We need to get that post-onboarding experience nailed down.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Nik Patel: Because what I want to do…

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Nik Patel: Time permitting, this week, or at least next week.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Nik Patel: I want to build, like, a full working app, where you just, like, log in using Google and…

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Nik Patel: We start to capture everything, um, so we need to, like, really have that…

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Nik Patel: Figured out to an extent.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Nik Patel: I want to, like, play… or do some dry runs.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Nik Patel: let's look at your email, let's look at my email type of thing, right? And so, like, if we had this, um, how is priority lenses.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Nik Patel: How is priority lens responding to it? And is that something that we want? What do we want to change?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Nik Patel: Because ultimately, product needs to speak for itself, right? And it can only speak for itself when…

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Nik Patel: It actually starts providing value right away, and we need to, like.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Nik Patel: Make sure that that's good, um, and we can, like.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Nik Patel: Continue to repeat that. So, um, all to say, onboarding, okay, I think we are getting pretty close on onboarding.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Nik Patel: Now, we need to understand post-onboarding and then daily experience, so we can bring people back.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Nik Patel: My thought there was…

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Nik Patel: We, um…

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Nik Patel: Initially, my thought was, even if I could convert my emails into my to-do list, and then essentially take some basic actions.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Nik Patel: Take music actions on my…

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Nik Patel: meetings, and then have a voice assistant where I could just, like, start directing it, like you were saying, right? Hey, this email came through, just go do this, go do this, and then…

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Nik Patel: it can start executing some of those actions, that will put us ahead of anyone that I have seen so far.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Nik Patel: So that's just an idea though, but the, the part where it gets, starts to get hard is we need to look at like a longer horizon.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Nik Patel: on how do we know what is the right project, how do we know it's working through, what actions do we take, what are Canvas experiences, all of that. So, in my mind, UX, I think, is a priority.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Nik Patel: And if we can nail that down, marketing probably will get easier on what we are providing anyway.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Nik Patel: I… I should mention this, so…

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Nik Patel: I'm waiting for Paula, um, I'm assuming you have met Paula?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, she's… I've never met her. Doctor, uh, yeah, she's pretty, uh, chill, pretty smart.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Nik Patel: Just on call, okay.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Nik Patel: Yep. So she's helping build the website right now, um, and one of the things that.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Nik Patel: She is building his day in life using priority lens.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Nik Patel: she showed it to me today, pretty good. I gave some feedback on, like, how I'm thinking, um, we could go even further.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Nik Patel: But I think as soon as I get access, I can provide it to you as well, to show what we are thinking about.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Nik Patel: I did not mention this to you, but I also went down this rabbit hole on how do we want the website to be looking.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Nik Patel: you had mentioned, um, animation and 3D animation and stuff like that, so I looked at some 3D animation websites. I think it's easier to, like.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Nik Patel: speak to animation… speak with animations than just text, so…

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Nik Patel: Went down this rabbit hole of, like, can we build some of those animations and make it easy for someone to understand what we are doing?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Nik Patel: Don't have any action items on it yet, but just something that I did as a research for myself.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Yeah, yeah, animation can be a rabbit, uh, trail.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Yep, um, we'll worry about it once we know what our product looks like.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Nik Patel: and maybe I'm wrong, but the way I'm thinking about it is, if we can get, like, 5 to 10 people to be addicted to the product, marketing will get much, much easier. Like, we know what we are doing, we know what people like and don't like, and whatnot.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Nik Patel: So then it's like talking the reality, then making up stuff, um…

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Nik Patel: So we want to nail that down first.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, definitely.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Josh Smith: Just processing everything.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Josh Smith: Alright, uh…

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Josh Smith: Alright. Paul is going to… I mean, with you…

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Josh Smith: Coordinate on a, uh, brand identity then, color schemes, fonts, all that, all that stuff.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Nik Patel: We are not talking about that right now. For… with her, it's mostly, like, uh, messaging.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Josh Smith: Messaging, okay.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, uh, branding, but not from, like, a color perspective. The branding guideline that I sent you.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Nik Patel: That was from her.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Nik Patel: But I don't think there is any…

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Nik Patel: any hard feelings on us basically focusing on that too, especially because some of that needs to go into the product itself, right? So…

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Nik Patel: I think she can help. We can coordinate, we could collaborate, we could move forward with it, and either is fine.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. Um…

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Josh Smith: Cool. Um, so just some basics, um…

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Josh Smith: Here, basic recommendation… I have many, many recommendations, but…

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Josh Smith: Um… you can always tell me to dial it up or dial it down.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Josh Smith: What I mean is, dialing it up is, I can get into the weeds and talk about, like.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Josh Smith: like…

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Josh Smith: Details and color, and spacing, and…

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Josh Smith: um…

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Josh Smith: Um… type scale…

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Josh Smith: I could start talking to you about the psychology of things where you'd be like, I don't care, Josh, just tell me what to do.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Josh Smith: Um, dial down would just be like, just tell me what to do.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Um, I think I'm more leaning towards the former, um…

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Josh Smith: What's up?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Nik Patel: still in favor of time, I'd lean on you to say, like, hey, go with this, we'll be okay.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Nik Patel: And then we can, like, go deeper. But the initial goal is to get it right to a point where we could launch.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Nik Patel: speed matters, just because I'm seeing, like, other companies are starting to get into it, so at least we want to put ourself out there.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Nik Patel: So I'll lean on you, and if you think, hey, go with sensory font or whatever.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Nik Patel: bigger point, I personally don't care.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Nik Patel: Like, go with this font and go with this typing spacing, go with this component.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Nik Patel: We'll just do that as a starting point, and then once we have a product in our hand.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Nik Patel: I think that's when we can say more, it's like, okay, this is making me feel better now, and we should have changed it to XYZ, but…

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Nik Patel: Sooner we get to working product, the better.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Josh Smith: Great. Yeah.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, there's things like choosing your grayscale, choosing the hue, the light hue that you want to apply to that grayscale. Most grayscales are not fully gray, of course, they have either cool or warm tones to it.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Josh Smith: Which one do you want to be? You know, where are you, you know, ChatGPT… most, most tools, like, uh, most tools, especially even ChatGPT, uh, will go cool.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Josh Smith: Um, you know, uh, Slack sometimes is more cool.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Josh Smith: Claude, of course, went way on the warm end, uh, on their, on their grayscale.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, but then that… that… that choice…

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Josh Smith: Affects all of your colors thereafter.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Josh Smith: Um, so… uh, and then… mhm.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Nik Patel: Um, for what it's worth, you know what the primary looks like right now. Tell us what we need to change there. I think some of those, I can rely on you.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Josh Smith: Oh.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Nik Patel: The only thing I can say is when I look at it, what I feel about it, but I don't have the technical expertise to say this makes sense or this does not.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys did show that to me.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Josh Smith: Let me find that again.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Josh Smith: One second…

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Josh Smith: What was that on? Was that, uh… was that, like, a Google Sheet or something?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Nik Patel: I think I sent an email as a PDF, probably.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Josh Smith: Alright. That's alright. Let me… I'll grab it. There it is, thank you.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Nik Patel: brand guidelines or something. Let me see if I can…

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Josh Smith: It was a PDF.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Josh Smith: And are these the ones that you chose, or the ones that Paula chose?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Nik Patel: Um, the logo that you are seeing, so here's… let me see if I can get a slack.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Nik Patel: I had come up with this logo that looked good, and then we said, it looks good enough, let's just go with it.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Nik Patel: And the colors are from there? I'm trying to see if I can find it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Nik Patel: You post it anywhere?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Josh Smith: I'm going to… I'm posting them right now.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Josh Smith: Yep.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Josh Smith: Let's talk about these colors for a sec, because I do have opinions.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yep, and you're going with Inter.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Josh Smith: Not sure…

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Nik Patel: Oh, I can't actually do it, I'm view only, duh.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Nik Patel: Let me do it here.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Nik Patel: I was trying to, like, move it, and I was like, why is it not pasting?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Josh Smith: Oh, uh, let me… let me give you, uh…

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I should… there you go.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Josh Smith: Oh, and Abby needs to update this seat so that they can edit.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Josh Smith: Did that work?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Nik Patel: We'll see. Uh…

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, good.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Josh Smith: Ooh, these are different now.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Josh Smith: I'm getting… hold on…

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Josh Smith: But you just pasted…

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Josh Smith: Are not the same colors.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, she might have changed some of it, for what it's worth.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Josh Smith: She meaning polar.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Nik Patel: Voila, yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay. What are we at here?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna put, uh, I'm gonna put hue values underneath, just so that I can…

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Josh Smith: Recall them.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Josh Smith: Let's go to enter.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Josh Smith: Inter is the new Helvetica, it has been for years.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Josh Smith: Uh, meaning the most neutral…

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Josh Smith: 5.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Josh Smith: Alright, you've got 174, that's gonna be close to… yeah, that's in between, this is 180.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Josh Smith: Uh, this is gonna be way on your cooler side, so this is gonna be…

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Josh Smith: Your Navy is, um…

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Josh Smith: These are completely different navies, too.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Josh Smith: Well, that's interesting.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Josh Smith: This one's not too… no, no, they're both 212.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Josh Smith: Both 212, let me just do this real quick, 188.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Josh Smith: Alright…

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Josh Smith: And what are you? You are 178?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Josh Smith: These are all over the place.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Josh Smith: Alright, and of course, this is… well, I don't need to do white. White is, like, uh…

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Josh Smith: Nothing. Okay.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so…

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Josh Smith: Alright, these aren't very distinct from one another, um…

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Josh Smith: Did you design this by hand or with AI?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Josh Smith: AI. Alright, and it represents a human, right? Uh, something, uh, maybe anthropomorphic, just two eyes, um…

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, 2Y is human, but um…

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Nik Patel: it's… so there are a couple things in here. Uh, human-AI collaboration, so both of them working together.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Nik Patel: The eye on the left-hand side also has, like, a radar, something that it's looking out for you.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Nik Patel: on what's going on in your world, and helping you with that. Uh, it's an agent, so I didn't want it to feel like it's a…

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Nik Patel: complete human. It's a system after all, so it has this cyborg feeling in a way.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Nik Patel: And, uh…

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Nik Patel: At the same time, it's your companion, so you should feel like you're talking to a natural thing, not a…

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Nik Patel: Uh, terminator.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Josh Smith: Hmm…

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Nik Patel: So, those were the things that went through, like, multiple iterations of it.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Nik Patel: Landed on this, there were, like, a couple other options, but this felt nature enough that we just went with it.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Nik Patel: This was done in Canva AI, by the way.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Nik Patel: Also, the thought was, can I do something as a logo that can be my app icon? And then it starts to create the, um…

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Nik Patel: sticky thing, that someone looks at it and say, I know what that is.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Josh Smith: I see. Okay.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Nik Patel: And we could change this, like, none of this is…

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Nik Patel: We haven't launched yet, so, like, if you want to make changes to this, um…

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Nik Patel: Fine with me.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Nik Patel: Again, I do want to be mindful of time, because this is a rabbit hole that.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Nik Patel: This was really hard to get out of.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Josh Smith: Uh, it can be. It can be.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Josh Smith: Um, I wouldn't say I would completely…

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Josh Smith: redo it. Um, I might, you know, I might recommend, um…

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Josh Smith: Cleaning up, cleaning up a bit.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Nik Patel: Sure, have it.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Josh Smith: And, uh, so…

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Josh Smith: I'll do that on my own time.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Josh Smith: There's, um…

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Josh Smith: There are things like…

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Josh Smith: this here, uh, so, like…

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, a smile is, um…

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Josh Smith: You ever heard of the phrase, you know, smiles in the eyes?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Josh Smith: Um, if you want to add a bit more…

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Josh Smith: Um… life to it.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Josh Smith: Um… instead of circles, and you can totally… you can totally say no to anything I… anything I…

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Josh Smith: I recommend, um…

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna do this real quick.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Josh Smith: Do that…

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Josh Smith: Close that in…

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Josh Smith: group that…

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Josh Smith: ask it…

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Josh Smith: Mm.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Josh Smith: Mmm… that… eh, that needs more love.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Josh Smith: Because I would want that to go full-on.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Josh Smith: I'll… I'll stop in a second, because…

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Josh Smith: It's, um…

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Josh Smith: Oops.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay…

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Josh Smith: And…

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Josh Smith: Go split it right in half.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Josh Smith: Yep, because that is right in half.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Josh Smith: And then this would need to go to zero.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Josh Smith: But let us can…

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Josh Smith: Not that you'd want Smiley.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you might want your circles instead.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Josh Smith: Still do that.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Josh Smith: And then make… make this more equidis.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Josh Smith: Equidistant in that corner.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Josh Smith: What am I doing here? Um…

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Josh Smith: Breaking it out, um…

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Josh Smith: I'm gonna use my… I'm gonna do some redlining here.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Josh Smith: There we go.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Josh Smith: So… wait.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Josh Smith: So, you'll notice right here, just…

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Josh Smith: There's a lot.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Josh Smith: You could say this is asymmetrical and not organic, and in a sense, inorganic, therefore it doesn't need any sense of.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Josh Smith: Balance, but these, these 3 lines, um, it might.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Josh Smith: It's not exactly clear where center is.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Josh Smith: Um, in a quadrant, which is okay.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Josh Smith: Also, your…

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Josh Smith: your circle here, I don't know if this was intentional or not, but your circle here is… up here is, uh…

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Josh Smith: Is off balance, creating a thinner, um…

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Josh Smith: Creating a thinner weight at the top and at the bottom.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Josh Smith: And I didn't know if that was intentional too, maybe it was.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Nik Patel: No, so the thinner was not intentional, but the asymmetrical part was intentional.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Tell me about the asymmetrical part.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Nik Patel: It's…

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Nik Patel: It's basically a messy world, in a way.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Nik Patel: right, that we are trying to bring focus into. So, asymmetrical part was there.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Nik Patel: one eye bigger versus one eye smaller was essentially that, right? Like, one's a cyborg eye, one's, like, a human eye type of thing.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Josh Smith: Ah, okay.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Nik Patel: And then, when I brought this up, Paula had said she likes the yin-yang motif.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Nik Patel: Uh, and she had said the same thing, like, bigger eye for focus looked good.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Nik Patel: Now, do we keep it or not? Whole different story, but that was the mindset.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, again, play with it. Like I said, the…

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Nik Patel: The thing going from, like, smaller to broader in terms of the circle, that was not…

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Nik Patel: I couldn't get it to be fixed, and so I was like, fine, whatever, we'll deal with it later.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Josh Smith: Like, whatever.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Um, you know, so…

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Josh Smith: Interestingly enough, if you position it this way, it… it looks tilted.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Josh Smith: So it looks centered and tilted, which actually, when you, when you tilt on your head, it's almost like the dog going, huh, like, it's a bit more personal, like, uh, and it adds a bit more personality to it, like, I'm curious, I'm inquisitive.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Josh Smith: I would want to, like, um…

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Josh Smith: I would want to…

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Josh Smith: Move that back, hold on.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Josh Smith: You're like, you can tell me to stop at any time, be like, Josh.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Josh Smith: Work on this on your own, we need to keep moving forward. Um…

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Josh Smith: Uh, mine stroke…

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, if you also round everything.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Josh Smith: Um… that can make it.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Josh Smith: Feel a bit more cohesive, because everything… everything's got commonality to it.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, so, I might recommend that, um…

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Josh Smith: Uh, separating everything, uh, so that it doesn't, uh, completely connect with one another allows folks especially um.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Josh Smith: Allows folks, especially who have difficulty differentiating between the subtlety in these 2 colors to be able to actually see them.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Josh Smith: Stuff like that.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Nik Patel: Yep. I mean, again, if you want to take a stab at this to see how can we make it more…

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Nik Patel: Simpler, follow the rules of…

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Nik Patel: Design and all that, um…

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Nik Patel: I think there is value in it.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Nik Patel: Ultimately…

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Nik Patel: The thought was, when you look at this icon, you should feel, like, that sense of calm that you have got someone that can, like.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Nik Patel: Help you get out of this.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Nik Patel: It's a never-ending world of things that you have to get done.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, like, as long as we feel that calmness, and it's like, yes, this is the app that I want to click on.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Nik Patel: Or this is the icon that I want to click on, and I know we can… we can get through it. Um…

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Nik Patel: If you can keep that feeling, everything else, colors, whatnot, I think that's completely fine too, whatever you want to change it to, including the logo style and everything.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Josh Smith: Cool. You see now, too, like, with that…

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Josh Smith: With the arch rather than the circle.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Josh Smith: it adds a bit more to it, like, I'm here to serve.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Josh Smith: I'm curious, I'm here to serve. Anyway…

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Nik Patel: So, the thing that I'm trying to make sense of are, like, those two outer circles.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Nik Patel: And then, if we do that, it feels like the…

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Nik Patel: The smile mouth part is missing.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Nik Patel: Somehow, but then if you do it, it's an emoji, and then it's like, well, that's not a… not an app logo.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Josh Smith: Mmm…

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Nik Patel: trying to, like, think through that. I like that…

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Nik Patel: One was an eye that could be, like, a human eyebrow, in a way, and then the other is just a dot, which is, like, a machine.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Nik Patel: But it's the bottom part that feels a bit missing.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Josh Smith: Down here.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm. Because there's, like, a huge blank space for nothing.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, where is that where, uh…

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Josh Smith: Did I totally delete?

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, that's fine, I can… I can copy it here again.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Josh Smith: Why did I do that?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Josh Smith: It was an accident.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Josh Smith: I see. Okay, play with it.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Nik Patel: Yep. Yeah, again, we haven't put anything out, so have it. Um, what I had done with the heads up.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Nik Patel: If you can see it. But Heads Up is like a magic wand with the circles on the top.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Josh Smith: Mmm.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Nik Patel: That was it, like, it's a… it's a thing that gets you there, and that was it.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Nik Patel: That was AI generated, too, so take it with a grain of salt.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Nik Patel: that was me just, like, asking for, like, different ideas that I wanted to get through.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Josh Smith: Alright, yep, I will, uh, I'll play around.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Josh Smith: I'll add some symmet… I'll add some symmetry, some math to it and everything. But, uh, yeah, let's go… let's move towards, um…

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Nik Patel: Awesome.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Josh Smith: What do you call it? You're the, um…

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Josh Smith: onboarding experience.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Nik Patel: Alright, um…

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Josh Smith: Oh, uh, another thing about these colors, too, um, they're nautical, if that's fine with you. These are normally nautical colors.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Josh Smith: Warm blues, cool blues, all different types of blues.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Josh Smith: The warm blues are hard, sometimes hard to match with the cool blues, um.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Josh Smith: They're on an… they're on an entirely different hue spectrum.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Josh Smith: Um, which is going to be…

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Josh Smith: Um, a challenge down the road, I would probably recommend is you design to, like, um, align to a single.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Josh Smith: a single set. So, what I mean? Deep navy, teal, and soft mint, at least, those from the color palette.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Josh Smith: 212, 188, 178, those are 3 different hues. Um, even though this one.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Josh Smith: Particular if you just, um…

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Josh Smith: If you just make that 188…

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Josh Smith: You've just aligned these to a single hue.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Josh Smith: Uh, you consolidated them a bit, and also, um…

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Josh Smith: You can create a sibling to that.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Josh Smith: If you want, these are… these are… there's…

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Josh Smith: Same saturation and, um…

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Josh Smith: Luminosity, just different hues. Um…

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Josh Smith: And so, I might do that on my own time, just create a scale, make some recommendations.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Josh Smith: Uh, also navy blue is corporate. Um, it is the most mundane corporate color. It does appeal to enterprise.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Josh Smith: Uh, considerably, so if you want to go down that route, you know, go for it. But in the B2C space.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Josh Smith: It has, um, generally, at an individual level, it has generally less appeal because it.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Josh Smith: It's so ubiquitous.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Josh Smith: So…

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Nik Patel: Got it.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Josh Smith: All right.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay, so we have, um… Welcome to Cortex, we get in.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Josh Smith: When you get in, the one… the big area I was struggling with is, uh, when you get in, anything can happen.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Josh Smith: And what do I mean? Like…

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Josh Smith: Like, how many scenarios?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Josh Smith: could occur.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, and.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Josh Smith: Is there a common… are there commonalities in how…

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Josh Smith: the interface responds. What do I mean? Um…

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Josh Smith: You, you tell, you, you tell them your projects.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Josh Smith: You tell Priority Lens all your projects and then.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Josh Smith: You get in, and then, um… let me go through this.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Josh Smith: um…

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Josh Smith: you agree on these things, scans email, scan meetings, scan contacts, done, your dashboard is ready for you. You look at the dashboard.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Josh Smith: First, let's get into a gathering session and get everything out that you think should be on the dashboard.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Josh Smith: And where I might go into the weeds is the scenarios, like…

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Josh Smith: you know, but I'll shut up first.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Josh Smith: vomit on me. All the ideas you had about this dashboard first.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Nik Patel: Uh, I…

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Nik Patel: Don't have much right on my mind right now.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Nik Patel: But here's what I have, and I'll start talking, and maybe more will come up. But high level, my thinking is this.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Nik Patel: What we want to do when we get on that screen is…

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Nik Patel: Showcase what… what my life's right now looking like.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Nik Patel: Right? So, reality is, someone told me 3, but they have 7 things going on, especially if they're busy professionals.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Nik Patel: can we surface those type of things? Like, okay, you said this 3, here's how it turns out, but…

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Nik Patel: You also have this coming up, what do you want to do with it?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Nik Patel: So that's one good way… I'm assuming it's gonna be pretty common, and if it doesn't happen, great, these are the only 3 things you need to worry about. Here's what it means.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Nik Patel: Both scenarios should work out.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Nik Patel: Then, what we want to bring their attention to is…

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Nik Patel: Yes, it might be a long-term thing, but this is what needs to happen.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Nik Patel: This is what needs to happen right now or next.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Nik Patel: More so than right now, this is what needs to happen next.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Nik Patel: And then, this is what needs to happen right now. Here's what I can do for you.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Nik Patel: Let's go.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Josh Smith: Now I'm gonna get into a scenario.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Josh Smith: I told them a project.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Josh Smith: I told Priority Lens a project.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Josh Smith: It went through and found an email thread related to it.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Josh Smith: it noticed that I…

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Josh Smith: I'm on the hook to respond to something.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Josh Smith: Um, maybe… let me be very specific. I'm on the hook…

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Josh Smith: To respond to somebody…

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Josh Smith: I'm on the hook to schedule a meeting.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Josh Smith: How about that? Start with there.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Nik Patel: So…

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Nik Patel: You had committed to scheduling a meeting, you have not.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Nik Patel: I could look up your calendar.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Nik Patel: coordinate with them, and I can get that meeting settled for you.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Nik Patel: based on what we had talked about, it seems like it should be 30-minute meeting. Do you want 30, 45, or 60?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Nik Patel: Whatever the options might be.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Nik Patel: Right? So they were talking about, let's set up a meeting, normally it's 3560.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Nik Patel: Or, sorry, 30, 60 meeting minutes meeting, that's pretty common.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Nik Patel: Um, if someone was talking about workshop, is it 60 or 2 hours? Are we talking a day?

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Nik Patel: Okay, pick one, or just talk to it and say, yeah, just go ahead and set a 30-minute meeting.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Nik Patel: from here on, I have drafted the email.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Nik Patel: I will send it out, when they respond, I'll coordinate with them, I'll give them times, I can take care of it from here on.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Josh Smith: I can coordinate with them on times.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Nik Patel: Right, right? That's the most common thing that comes up, is like, hey, what time do you want? Well, I can do this, but I cannot do that, and the only answer to that is, here's my…

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Nik Patel: calendar link, go do it yourself. That's generally the only answer that I have seen so far.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Nik Patel: Aui, who is a competitor product, supposedly does this well. I haven't used it myself.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Nik Patel: The problem itself is pretty straightforward.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Nik Patel: if my calendar is available, if I know what type of meeting I want.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Nik Patel: My mind is straight, now go work with the other person. Can we get that scheduled? And can we get that schedule within the time frame that both of us have?

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Nik Patel: we need this meeting right away, or as soon as possible. Okay, we are trying to find something within the next.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Nik Patel: week or so.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Nik Patel: Likelihood of what's gonna happen is we ask them a time, they come back and give us some time.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Nik Patel: the branching logic there is the time is available, in which case I'm gonna block it, or put a hold on what times I have sent them.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Nik Patel: Just so you know, those are the ones I'm trying to block for you anyway.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Nik Patel: It doesn't mean anything, right? It's just a hold.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Nik Patel: If they come back and they say, okay, well, this don't work, but this work, the branching logic is.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Nik Patel: can I move my meeting somewhere else? And if so, let's do that and agree to the time.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Nik Patel: can I not move my meeting? Then we are asking for the time, and then we are going back and forth again. And that's the loop that just…

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Nik Patel: Keeps happening till both of them… all the parties agree to it.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Nik Patel: If system can take care of it, that in itself is a…

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Nik Patel: You saved me, like, 10 minutes of time.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Nik Patel: And if you do this 10 times on a month, that's, uh, 100 minutes of, like, hour and a half of time, great.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Nik Patel: It's something I don't have to think about, I would love it. I would pay $20 for that, just for that.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Josh Smith: Just for that one feature.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Um, but you get the idea, right? It's, um…

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Nik Patel: broader level, what we have talked, I guess, just going back to your use case.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Nik Patel: there is an action item that needs to be taken. Someone needs to take that action item.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Nik Patel: Or someone needs to take that action. If that someone is me, let's take that action. If that someone is someone else, let's follow up with them.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Nik Patel: Right? It's probably that straightforward, hopefully in the beginning, and then we can start to get more nuanced.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Now, this scenario right here…

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Josh Smith: one of…

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Josh Smith: Hundreds of different scenarios.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Josh Smith: However, the way that gets solved…

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Josh Smith: in the product.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Josh Smith: could be unique.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Josh Smith: So, it…

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Josh Smith: It's almost as if, um…

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Josh Smith: And I want to make sure I'm thinking about this accurately.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Josh Smith: This scenario.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Josh Smith: Are you… are you gonna be working on these scenarios, like…

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Josh Smith: Almost like feature by feature, like, you can do this, it can do this, it can do this, now it can do this.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Nik Patel: I… I believe so, um…

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Nik Patel: the hard part is, a lot of this, like, LLM can reason through, but there's gonna be, like, an immense amount of cost that I might end up taking on as a product, and we need to work through it.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Nik Patel: in the beginning, I'm not worried about it, because if we can get…

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Nik Patel: a sticky product, rest of it can start to work out. We could essentially go from what Cloud Code did, right? Like, start with 20 and then go to 100 and 200, and…

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Nik Patel: We just increase the price in itself if we need to. That aside.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, some of them will have to be in the beginning, some of them will have to come later.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Nik Patel: I just don't know…

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Nik Patel: How hard any of these are yet, just till we try it out.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I mentioned because…

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Josh Smith: when I mentioned, like, what are the top 3 scenarios, I guess that would be, like, what are the top 3 features that you want to release with?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Josh Smith: Um, because when I see this scenario, I'm like, okay.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Josh Smith: That would be cool. I'm on… hey, you need to schedule this meeting, would you like us to schedule it for you? First, if it said, would you like us to schedule it for you, I'd be like, what are you talking about?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Josh Smith: Blows my mind. What?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Josh Smith: And then, yeah, I can, um… also, if it said, looks like…

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Josh Smith: Looks like it's a workshop. Two hours. Here's an agenda.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Josh Smith: We know what the meeting is about.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Josh Smith: Gathered all the information, we've went to the web even, and figured out.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Josh Smith: As much as we can.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Josh Smith: Review this, edit this as necessary.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Josh Smith: Um, here's who we assume the participants are, is this correct? Great. Um…

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Josh Smith: And we'll take care of it. We'll get back to you when we've got a meeting scheduled.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Josh Smith: And then, after that, I'm assuming it…

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Josh Smith: It starts talking… sending emails.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Josh Smith: Um… so, like, no Slack integration yet.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Josh Smith: It's just sending emails back and forth with all the other participants about, hey.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Josh Smith: You know, looking at these 3 dates, which, you know, email me back, which ones do you think are good?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Josh Smith: Um, and it just starts making those recommendations until you get, like, a yes or an affirmation from everyone.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Josh Smith: Could also potentially have a, uh… little ad in there that, you know, if you're also using priority lens.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Josh Smith: You don't have to do the email back and forth.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Josh Smith: Because you're…

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Josh Smith: priority lens agent. If Bob's priority lens agent here.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Josh Smith: Knows that you're… you have a priority lens agent.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, those agents work out themselves, yeah.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Josh Smith: They work it out themselves, you're not gonna have to email anyone back.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Josh Smith: That comes to another product.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Josh Smith: idea, which is, if they know the email address, and that email address is associated with a Priority Lens account.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Josh Smith: It somehow indicates in the experience that it will be talking to that person's agent.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Josh Smith: Rather than that person.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Nik Patel: Yeah. Um, yeah, it's similar to what iPhone does, right? Like, if it's an iPhone-to-iPhone, you have, like.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Nik Patel: messages versus iPhone to Android's green.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I did talk to Paula about this.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Nik Patel: Asian companion, the whole idea was something similar, is if we need to do a meeting, can these agents, like, talk themselves first, and then set up a meeting when they tell me?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Nik Patel: And the person's like, we have actually tried to figure this out ourselves, and here's what we have come up with, take it from here.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Nik Patel: it's pretty… pretty complex to do it that way, but that's… I think that's where we would end up going.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Josh Smith: This is down the road.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Nik Patel: That said, I think rest of it, what you said. Let me put it this way.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Nik Patel: I don't know what people would like the most.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Nik Patel: Meeting just showing up on their calendar when they don't know about it.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Nik Patel: And how do we, like… so, for example, let's say I'm on the…

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Nik Patel: This agents talked it out and then set up the meeting.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Nik Patel: now the brief becomes extremely important, because I would have not known when that meeting got set up, because I was not in the loop anymore.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Nik Patel: Right, so my prep is even more important than before, because before, I would have, like, known when the meeting's coming up, so in the back of my mind.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Nik Patel: It's like, oh, I'm gonna talk to Josh next week, I need to, like, prep for it. If the meeting got set up, and you didn't know, and I didn't know, and both of us are supposed to show up, it's like, what the.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Nik Patel: Right? Um, and that…

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Nik Patel: Is an after-effect of doing something that sounded cool up front, but it needs to stay cool throughout the process.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Nik Patel: So, when the meeting shows up, now it needs to tell me, like, hey, this is what the meeting's gonna look like, and that's when the daily brief comes pretty handy.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Josh Smith: Good.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Nik Patel: So it's a more complete experience at that point.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. In this one scenario feature, it can be enhanced and grow over time.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, we'll continue to improve upon it, yeah.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Josh Smith: I mean, as you integrate with more…

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Josh Smith: Products that the person has that adds context that can fill in the gaps.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Josh Smith: The complexity and nuance of…

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Josh Smith: Well, I need to, yeah, I need to set up a meeting, but I need a meeting before the meeting as well, and um I need a meeting after the meeting, like a, like a reflection or a.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Josh Smith: Post, um…

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Josh Smith: Uh, post-mortem, like, so, the V, the V now, the version now, I guess.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Josh Smith: We just talked about this scenario. For you, do you have a priority list of those scenarios, and the one you want to lead… the ones you want to lead with?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Nik Patel: when I'm thinking about that agents talk to each other, I… I think what…

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Nik Patel: Taking a step back for a second, what we need to think through is… right now, we are thinking from one person's perspective.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Nik Patel: if we step back and think from a system perspective, let's say you are… you and I need to set up a meeting, right?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Nik Patel: You said that you would set up a meeting, and…

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Nik Patel: priority lines told you that you need to set up a meeting, do you want me to take care of it for you?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Nik Patel: So you say yes, and then you let it handle it. Then it figures out the meeting needs to be with me.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Nik Patel: and it sends me an email to say, like, Nick, Josh can do this time, can you?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Nik Patel: technically, if I have a priority lens, too, that email coming in.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Nik Patel: Should essentially be taken into, like, oh, someone's asking for this time, let me just work it out with you.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Nik Patel: So, my priorities tells me, Josh is asking for a meeting, do you want the meeting? Yes, take care of it.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Nik Patel: And then those agents should be able to talk it out up front to begin with.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Josh Smith: So you want that to be V… you want that to be version now?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Nik Patel: Yes.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Nik Patel: wouldn't it… wouldn't that how it's go, is what I'm saying.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Josh Smith: Ideally, if they both have priority lens, yes.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, if they don't have it, then sure, there's nothing to do, we'll just… we'll just take the incomings and handle them.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Josh Smith: Thanks.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Nik Patel: Now, again, how far we go is technicality of it, I still need to figure out. There's a whole scheduling world that.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Nik Patel: that they've been trying to solve this, so… and they haven't, so I'm not sure what I'm signing myself up for, but, um…

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Nik Patel: Ideally, that's…

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Nik Patel: That's how it should go as a system, right?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Uh, yeah, that is.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Josh Smith: Okay, hey, yeah, hey, Nick wants to schedule a meeting, you want me to take care of it and find some time? Yes, please. Okay, good, thanks.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, right, and then agents figure this out yourself.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Nik Patel: And then give me a brief, give me meeting agenda, everything just should be on the meeting itself.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Yeah. And then, like, if I need to… if you think I need to prepare for it, priority lens.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Nik Patel: Yep, okay.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Josh Smith: Block out some time for me.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, block out time, create a to-do task.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Nik Patel: That's… that's good.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Josh Smith: Now, I just… is… is this scenario…

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Josh Smith: I'm on the hook to schedule a meeting.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Josh Smith: Or, conversely.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Josh Smith: Bob's on the hook to schedule a meeting over here.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Josh Smith: Someone's on the hook to schedule a meeting.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Josh Smith: And I can help coordinate it, or I can help poke the person who needs to schedule it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Josh Smith: Is that number one for you, in terms of what… expressing what this thing can do?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Josh Smith: For the dashboard, are there other scenarios?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I… so, is this number one? It is very high on the priority. I don't know what is number one, to be frank.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Nik Patel: Here's how I think about it, though. When we are looking at emails, there are certain things that is FYI.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Nik Patel: So we labeled them, it's like, you just need to know about it, I'll give you a brief, and you are good, right? Don't think about it again, we are done, done, we'll wait for the next one to come through.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Nik Patel: Then there are emails where action is necessary.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Nik Patel: Action could be, I'm going to respond to an email and we are done.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Nik Patel: Action could be someone else needs to respond, and I want them to, so I'm gonna nudge them.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Nik Patel: or I need to take an action. So I think if we start to build that.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Nik Patel: hierarchical approach?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Nik Patel: Um… when will…

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Nik Patel: let's, I guess, think through this, right? So what generally happens is an email comes through.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Nik Patel: Your first reaction is, what is this email about? If you have been going back and forth on it.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Nik Patel: For quite some time, you generally know looking at it to see what's going on, just because you look at the person that is responding.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Nik Patel: And you know what that person you're talking to him about, generally it's like 5 to 7 things, not more than that.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Nik Patel: Right? Um, because you know the person, then you look at the subject line and you have an idea, oh, this is what we were talking about, I know what.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Nik Patel: what I need to know.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Nik Patel: Then, when you actually look at the response, then you have different…

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Nik Patel: different things happen. One, the person responded to something, and then, um…

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Nik Patel: That either generated an action item.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Nik Patel: That generated something for you to just respond to.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Nik Patel: Um, and be done with it. So as… because someone told you something, now you're going to respond.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Nik Patel: That's not true. When someone told you something, it's just an FYI. Good to know, I'm not gonna do anything with it, and it's a straight-up thumbs up, which…

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Nik Patel: Outlook has added at this point, you thumbs up and you're done with it, right? So you just react to it, you let the person know you reacted, and there is, like, literally nothing more that needs to happen.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Nik Patel: The second thing that generally goes through.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Nik Patel: Beyond that, is I looked at it, and now something needs to happen.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Nik Patel: that something that needs to happen could be me doing it. I'm gonna hand it over to someone else to do it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Nik Patel: I'm gonna ask the person back to say, can you do XYZ before I can do my own XYZ?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Nik Patel: So, that's just drafting emails and figuring out what to draft and send.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Nik Patel: Right? If I need to do it.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Nik Patel: That could be now even more hierarchical. It could be, I know what I need to say and I can just say it and be done with it.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Nik Patel: Right? Start talking, I'm gonna clean up your message in your own tone, and I'm gonna hand it out.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Nik Patel: If I need to schedule it, because I need to think about it.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Nik Patel: then either I keep it unread or whatnot.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Nik Patel: And at some point, I go to it. Generally, it's on the back of my mind, and I forget about it, and it's like a…

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Nik Patel: Thing that just weighs on me, because the notification bubble just, like, says 1, 2, whatever.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Nik Patel: That's one way for me to know that I need to take care of two items, and then some I forget anyway.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Nik Patel: So if I… if I need time for it, it goes into…

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Nik Patel: Can I talk to Priority Lens and say.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Nik Patel: alright, let's… let's respond to them that I'll think about it and get back to you tomorrow, and then find a time for me tomorrow to think about it, or think about it, tell me, and then we'll discuss and then hand it out.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Nik Patel: Right? That's another, just, I need to respond to it, and think about it, and do something with.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Nik Patel: Then there could be, like, a longer action item. Hey, prepare a budget. Well, for budget, I need 3 hours of time.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I can't do it now.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Nik Patel: it's due, we need to do it before, we need to push the time, whatever. So, start to do all sorts of calendar gymnastics. I'm gonna move that meeting, I'm gonna do this here, it needs to happen, I need to let people know, whatever that might be.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Nik Patel: So those are, like, some action items.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Nik Patel: But I'm essentially driving and orchestrating. This needs to happen for that, that needs to happen.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Nik Patel: If it is straight up delegation.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Nik Patel: adding Josh to this, hey Josh, can you take care of this?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Nik Patel: Once you do it, I'll do something and whatnot.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Nik Patel: Delegation happened, now I need to track that.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Nik Patel: Last but not the least, this sounds good, let's set up time, and we'll talk about it. Or I'm gonna involve someone, and we'll set up time and talk about it.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Nik Patel: So, high level, what's really happening is, person, subject.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Nik Patel: task, based on the task and severity of task, urgency of the task.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Nik Patel: Either I do it, I schedule it, or I work with someone else to schedule it, or I delegate that.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Nik Patel: if we have some sort of, like, mechanism like that, I think we can do a lot.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Nik Patel: Just with the system and start to cover lots of scenarios in one shot.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Nik Patel: One shot.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Because I… I see what you're doing, if you… if we can…

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Josh Smith: If we can put a system around this that's replicable.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Josh Smith: We don't have to care so much about satisfying… providing… designing a unique solution for every.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Josh Smith: Everyone scenarios.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Josh Smith: Which is ideal.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Josh Smith: Because, um…

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Josh Smith: Okay, I have an idea.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Josh Smith: Most of my ideas are terrible.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Nik Patel: Mine too.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Josh Smith: But I'm thinking about the simplicity… I'm thinking about the idea of how…

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Josh Smith: The magic in this can often be in the simplicity.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Josh Smith: It's often rooted in how simple it seems.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Josh Smith: Dashboard, the word itself, connotates complexity of data and information scrunched into a really small space.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Josh Smith: Claustrophobic, uh, inability to truly, to really understand what you're looking at.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Josh Smith: And how to look at it, and how to process the information.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Josh Smith: What if…

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Josh Smith: Imagine a scenario where it says, you know, take me in.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Josh Smith: And…

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Josh Smith: It shows you one thing at a time.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Josh Smith: And it's like, okay…

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Josh Smith: Here's… here's one thing.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Josh Smith: That we know needs to be done.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Josh Smith: One thing of… we could say one thing of eight.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Josh Smith: Let's focus on this one first.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Josh Smith: And… they have an experience.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Josh Smith: Where they can focus on that one thing on the screen.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Josh Smith: Nothing else.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Josh Smith: maybe we can have the dashboard, maybe we can have the navigation there, but the real goal is, I just need you to focus on this one thing.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Josh Smith: You're on the hook to schedule a meeting.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Josh Smith: Looks like it's this project.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Josh Smith: Would you like us to set up the meeting for you?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Nik Patel: Uh-huh.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Josh Smith: You want to delegate to someone else. You can either…

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Josh Smith: Select from a list of options, or you can…

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Josh Smith: Talk through it with the agent.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Josh Smith: You say, alright, I'm gonna have a back-and-forth conversation with them.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Josh Smith: Maybe it could start that way, where it's talking.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Josh Smith: And it's saying, hey, we notice you need to schedule a meeting.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Josh Smith: Before this time period.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Josh Smith: Um, it looks like this kind of meeting, it's, um…

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Josh Smith: Um, it's about this, and here are the potential participants.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Josh Smith: Would you like me to coordinate times and schedule this for you? And you could say, yeah, go for it, and you could say, no, ignore this, I'll take care of it.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Josh Smith: Or you could say.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Josh Smith: Could you… could you…

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Josh Smith: Ask John to do this.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Josh Smith: And it goes, you know.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Josh Smith: It does its processing, it goes, sure.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Josh Smith: We got it. Next thing.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Josh Smith: And it goes to the next thing.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Josh Smith: And same template experience.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Josh Smith: You know, here's the subject.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Josh Smith: Here's the person we believe is responsible.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Josh Smith: you know, here's the task. You have to either respond to this email, or someone else has to respond to it, or you have to take an action.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Josh Smith: Um, and what would you like done with this one?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Josh Smith: You got it. Goes to the next one.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Josh Smith: And then that's the dash… that's the dashboard experience.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Josh Smith: Just getting through those. You can decide to ignore all of them if you want, you can go through each one.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Josh Smith: And once it's done, and say, okay.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Josh Smith: You're good.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Josh Smith: What's the dashboard experience after that? I don't know, it could be…

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Josh Smith: Like, it could be, like…

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Josh Smith: we've… based… based on everything in your email, you're… you're clean. Like…

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Josh Smith: You're… you're good.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Josh Smith: If you want to see…

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Josh Smith: the progress.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Josh Smith: of these things.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Josh Smith: You can go here.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Josh Smith: Um, but we'll let you know.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Josh Smith: Well, maybe we'll have a section that's just, like… maybe we'll just have, like, a little, like, fade-in, like…

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Josh Smith: Notification, like, hey…

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Josh Smith: You're scheduled for this time. Hey, John said he'll do it. Don't worry about it.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Josh Smith: Hey, you know, um…

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Josh Smith: But… the idea of the dashboard, the main screen.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Josh Smith: being, like, um…

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Josh Smith: very focused on…

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Josh Smith: One at a time.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Josh Smith: Here are the thing, here are the things.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Josh Smith: That I can take care of for you, that we know need to be done.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Josh Smith: Um… I don't know.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Josh Smith: What are your thoughts about a direction like that?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Nik Patel: few things. Um, I love the idea of having one thing in front, because then we can use that screen asset to be able to show more about that thing.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Nik Patel: And we can keep the context about that one thing. So, love that idea.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Nik Patel: Couple thoughts on this, um…

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Nik Patel: when I'm in an execution mode, when I'm trying to get some stuff done, this makes total sense.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Nik Patel: Right? So it's like, alright, let's see what's on my list, let's start to knock them out.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Nik Patel: Right? Alright, let's do this, done, let's do this, done, let's do this, done. At some point, we are done.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Nik Patel: Right? That experience in itself, when I'm in that mode, totally makes sense.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Nik Patel: when I want an eagle view, where it's not like what I'm…

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Nik Patel: what I need to get done right now, I'm not trying to take action, I'm trying to just get the lay of the land on, like, what's going on in my life right now.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Nik Patel: What is that?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Josh Smith: What if they were two separate experiences?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Nik Patel: they should, is where I was going. So I like the idea of, let's not even drop them onto something yet. It's like, alright, now that we have looked at this, now we have understood you from that onboarding experience.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Nik Patel: Seems like we have captured 7 things. Let's go through them real quick.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Nik Patel: You have to set up this meeting.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Nik Patel: Here's what we could do. Do you want me to do it? Sure. Done. Here's about this.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Nik Patel: What do you want me to do about it? Well, set up 30 minutes. Alright, I found it tomorrow, I'll set it up. Are you good? Done? Move on.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Nik Patel: So, instead of lending them on a dashboard, starting to knock stuff out is a great experience, because now we are providing immediate value.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Josh Smith: And…

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Nik Patel: So, onboarding, take me in.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Nik Patel: Makes sense.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Josh Smith: And it's…

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Josh Smith: And execution mode is, like, you're in the forest.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Josh Smith: Whereas, seeing it, seeing the forest through your Eagle view, it's like raising it up and seeing all the stuff.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Nik Patel: All the stuff that's moving around everywhere.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Josh Smith: So you onboard, it takes you straight into execution mode, because that's where your brain is.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Nik Patel: Right.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Josh Smith: And it's usually not until you take care of those things you go like, alright, oh, now I want to go out.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Nik Patel: Okay, now I want to go up high. I agree. So that makes sense. Um…

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Nik Patel: as I was thinking about it, one thing that was…

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Nik Patel: Just a thought that came to my mind is here's what Priority Lens is doing for you and you can see everything that we are.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Nik Patel: capturing, so you can just look it out and you could force it if you want to do something with it. Here's everything you need to do.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Nik Patel: Let us know how we can help.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Nik Patel: Right, so that's a good experience, just because we are bringing Priority Lens, like, a level up, to say we are not just an AI, we are.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Nik Patel: Your companion, sort of, like, mindset.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Josh Smith: Is that a seeing… is that an Eagle view?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Nik Patel: Now, EagleView is different. So, what you need to get done is…

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Nik Patel: Hey, you are… you are leading this, I'm… I'm helping.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Nik Patel: What Priority Lens is doing is I'm doing it, you could take a look at this and do something with it, but I don't need you, because I'll take care of it.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Nik Patel: Right? When I need you, it's gonna go back into the list of what you need to do.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Nik Patel: The eagle-eye view is, I have 7 projects going on, things are looking good, here's where we are, I have captured the information that I needed to capture in my own mind, and I can move on.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Nik Patel: Or, I'll basically go from there to, like, execution mode again. Like, oh, this project, huh.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Nik Patel: Seems like things are going good, but I don't feel right, let me read through it. Oh, shoot. Yes, John did this, and he's supposed to do this, or…

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Nik Patel: We had talked about this at the water cooler moment, and something needed to happen. Let me start, like.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Nik Patel: Initiate an action that was not captured anywhere.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Josh Smith: That's where…

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Josh Smith: And that's where a lot of tools get it wrong, because they want to go to the dashboard view, but there's not enough data.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Josh Smith: Collected to get a full picture of that.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Josh Smith: Oh, you're mute now.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Nik Patel: Sorry, I just told my wife I'm coming down in 15 minutes.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay, sorry.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Josh Smith: Um… yes.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Josh Smith: So, Eagle views, here are your projects, here's the status, here's what we know, here's what we don't know.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Nik Patel: Right.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Josh Smith: Here, you can go into each project if you want, and you can upload more documents and information, and we'll process it, and we'll…

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Nik Patel: Something, yeah.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Josh Smith: We'll fill out more of the details.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Josh Smith: We use the deadlines, here's the players, here is the end goal.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Josh Smith: Here's the next step.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, here's your game board, in a way.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Josh Smith: Here's…

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, here's a game board, here's the next step, here's what we know you want to accomplish, here's what we're doing right now.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Josh Smith: Um, we'll let you know when you need to do something.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Josh Smith: Um, and we… and you can go into each pro- project.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Josh Smith: And you can provide more context.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Josh Smith: As much context as you like in order to fill that out, whether it's by typing it out, uploading it, or having a conversation.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Josh Smith: Um, so that that eagle view needs to be… when you go from execution mode to, alright, you're done, now we're gonna go to eagle mode.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Josh Smith: That first ego mode is going to be…

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Josh Smith: A little piecemeal.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Josh Smith: So it'd have to be like a, here's what we know, let's guide… now let's guide you into providing us more information.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Nik Patel: Guide us through this, yeah.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and show you the experience of having a project. And now let's have a one-on-one with the…

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Josh Smith: with priority lens on, like, which project's the most important right now? We already know that, actually, because we said in the beginning, so this is the most important project.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Josh Smith: Let's talk about it.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Nik Patel: Yep, um, now that I'm thinking about it, what if the bottom navigation was just this views?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Nik Patel: your eagle view there, you need to get it done, here's what Priority Lens is doing for you, and that's our view.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Nik Patel: Right? And then you click on one, and the different experiences start on one way or the other.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Nik Patel: But what is still on the homepage? Like, when you land, what is that… what do we start with?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Josh Smith: Now, execution mode.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Nik Patel: By default, it's execution mode, is what you're saying.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Nik Patel: Okay, I like that.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Josh Smith: that, I mean, that's my gut, like…

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Josh Smith: I'm in the weeds, I need to get out of the weeds so I can see the full picture, so what are the things I need to take care of? Execution mode.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Josh Smith: Um, and that could enhance go hands over time where you say, I need to.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Josh Smith: I know you missed some things.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Josh Smith: priority lines, um, let's, let's add a few things together.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, okay.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Nik Patel: Yes, I think that's good, so…

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Nik Patel: As soon as you open the app, regardless of onboarding or not, when you come back, you are back to execution mode.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Nik Patel: Hey, 15 things happened, here's FYI, here's what we need to knock down, are you ready? Yes, let's go.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Josh Smith: Yes. Yes.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Nik Patel: Right? Or no, this is good to know, I'm just gonna switch my mode, and then I'm on to something else.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Josh Smith: No, I want to go to Eagle mode, or Eagle view. I gotta… I need to refine this project a bit. New information came that you don't have access to yet.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Josh Smith: And I'd like you to… I'd like you to write this…

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Josh Smith: This email for me.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Nik Patel: I think… yeah.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Josh Smith: So…

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Nik Patel: Okay. I like that.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Nik Patel: Um…

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Nik Patel: the mindset will be different, right? So, like.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Nik Patel: The interesting part here is we are not even talking about emails or meetings anymore, which meetings brief and stuff like that we have to.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Josh Smith: Nope.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Nik Patel: How do we prep them for what's coming versus what you need to do right now?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Nik Patel: Is that a fourth mode?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Nik Patel: So…

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Nik Patel: execution mode.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Nik Patel: To prep mode.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Nik Patel: Here's what you need to do, here's what I need… I'm doing, eagle eye.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Nik Patel: I'm sure we'll simplify this even further, but you see the difference between, I have 3 meetings coming up, can I read up the brief as I'm walking?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Nik Patel: Which is nothing to do with… I need to prep for something, or sorry, I need to look at Eagle Eye.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Nik Patel: what I need to execute. It's just simply, I'm…

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Nik Patel: ingesting the information, so I can be ready.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Nik Patel: And how do I get to it faster?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Josh Smith: Prep mode. Is that…

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Josh Smith: Prep for the day? Prep for tomorrow.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Nik Patel: prep for what's next few items in general. And you could… and then you can, like, start to zoom out if you need to prep for something else, so be it.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Josh Smith: Great.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Josh Smith: Next.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Nik Patel: But prep mode is different than an execution mode. Execution, action, action, action. Prep is ingestion, ingestion.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Nik Patel: what I… what do I need to do? That's a task mode. Which task mode might be the execution mode in itself?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Nik Patel: Right, we can combine them somehow, and then what AI is doing is I just want to make sure that you are going in the right direction, and.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Nik Patel: Because AI trust needs to be built, and I think what AI is doing needs to be, like, a separate thing where we could show all the stuff that we are knocking out of.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Josh Smith: Hmm.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Josh Smith: Okay, and what AI's doing could be… there could be a way to access that that doesn't feel primary.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Josh Smith: Um…

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Nik Patel: The reason I… yes, agreed. It can be, like, somehow we can get to it. The reason I like that to be primary is just so that we could show value as a business.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Nik Patel: But second, you can just look at everything that AI is doing. It's like, okay, I'm gonna let it be, and I can go back to my mode.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Nik Patel: Um, it's more so, like, checking someone's work.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Nik Patel: Um, until we build the trust, I think we need that so that we are… I anticipate people not giving us full control day one.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Josh Smith: Gotcha. Alright.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Josh Smith: Um, this prep mode. How about…

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Josh Smith: You probably gotta jump soon. How about Wednesday we dig into prep mode?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Nik Patel: Prep mode or execution mode?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Josh Smith: Well… alright, here's what we can do.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Josh Smith: Do you wanna… break… do you wanna go deep in execution mode and actually come out with some wireframes?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Nik Patel: Uh… yes. I think whatever we do, we should end up in a wireframe, so we could put that aside and then move on to the next one. I'm sure we'll change things around.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Nik Patel: But it seems like the thing that we talked about today is a wireframe for what our default state needs to look like.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And prep mode, I think we should talk about prep mode and go into the details there, because.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Josh Smith: Tell me if I'm wrong, but that seems like it could also include, like, here's what your day looks like.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Josh Smith: You only have, you know, you only have 30 minutes to eat.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Josh Smith: Back and forth, um…

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Josh Smith: Even, like, here are some recommendations for the day, um…

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Josh Smith: Um, I have a list of websites to go to. Uh, yeah, I have a list of websites for you to go to, I have a list of documentation here.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Josh Smith: Uh, but… here's the most immediate next thing.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Josh Smith: You need to focus on. Don't… yeah, I got all this taken care of. Look at this first. Um…

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Josh Smith: So, okay, that does need to be a mode. Um…

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Nik Patel: And we can decide if prep… after onboarding, execution mode sounds more natural.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Nik Patel: Because we are in that mode, and default mode could be prep mode. You come in and, like, here's the things that you need to know about prep about. If you're ready to execute, let's jump into that mode. And I don't know which way we'll go, but it could be that too.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Josh Smith: Mm-hmm.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Josh Smith: Alright, so we'll keep talking about that.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Josh Smith: then let's… on Wednesday, let's get some wireframes together for execution mode, get that out of the way.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Josh Smith: And then… wonder whether… what you want to go…

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Josh Smith: Uh, what you want to talk about next, whether it's get wireframes for prep mode or wireframes for eagle view.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Josh Smith: What that looks like to manage the project, so…

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Nik Patel: I think prep first, so execution prep eagle, because eagle basically comes to a point where we have something to show, right? So I think that it's okay if it came a little bit later.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Nik Patel: And yeah, if you… if you are thinking about it, and if you're, like, jotting it down, or if you want to just, like, send me voice notes or text notes or something, I can start to think about it too, but…

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Nik Patel: I like the idea of execution mode on Thursday, or Wednesday.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Josh Smith: Alright, how do you feel about this time?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Nik Patel: Pretty good, pretty good.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Josh Smith: Okay, it was…

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Josh Smith: Productive?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Nik Patel: Absolutely, I think the whole thought of, like, let's keep it simple, um…

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Nik Patel: just resonated well, that's what we are supposed to do as a company anyway. So, just taking all the clutter away.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Nik Patel: Especially what stuck was the perception of it being simple matters, regardless of how complex it is behind the scene.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Josh Smith: Yeah. Yeah. We have to surprise people at how simple it feels, and not that we're, like, vomiting everything back to them.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Josh Smith: Because they came here so that…

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Josh Smith: Because they didn't want that.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Nik Patel: They didn't want that, yeah.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Josh Smith: And if we're suddenly like, well, we have all these objects, let's show all these objects on the page back to them.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, we lose them.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Josh Smith: Scare them away, so…

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I like that. Alright, this is great. Yeah, this was really helpful. Thank you.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay. Cool. Take care, man.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Nik Patel: Well, feel better.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Josh Smith: Thanks. Later.
