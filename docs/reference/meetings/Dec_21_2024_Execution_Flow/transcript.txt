00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Josh Smith: No, I don't… I don't mind if you record this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Nik Patel: I was gonna say, I'm gonna get to that faster.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Nik Patel: Alright, uh, is it in progress?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Nik Patel: Alright, let's get to it. Well, hopefully you're feeling better, it is going well, let's get to it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah, thanks man, yeah.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Nik Patel: Sorry about that, that's on me. I did not even realize the time.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Josh Smith: Dude.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Josh Smith: It's all good, man, I'm on your time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, but like, I had said I would be there and I, I actually randomly just opened the phone and saw your message, oh, it's already that time, you know, it's like, come on.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Josh Smith: Yes, sir.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Nik Patel: Gotta get back together.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Josh Smith: It's all good.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Nik Patel: You bet.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Josh Smith: Okay. I got ideas here, and if Bo ever told you about me, I tend to have ideas that are, like, way off the deep end of what people are expecting.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Josh Smith: So… okay.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Nik Patel: In a good way, yeah.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, so…

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Josh Smith: We just got off of this concept.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Josh Smith: So, let me just put it next to this one.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Josh Smith: And, um, in some… I feel like…

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, we could go right back into it. But before we do, um, here's a concept for navigation, maybe terrible.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Josh Smith: whether it's called… I mean, it's… whether it's called Execution Mode or whatever.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Nik Patel: Packard mode, getting done mode.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Josh Smith: What mode, you say?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Nik Patel: God mode, get it done.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Josh Smith: God mode, get…

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Josh Smith: Get… get it done…

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Josh Smith: GID mode?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Nik Patel: Oh, yeah, good morning.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Nik Patel: Anyway, um…

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Josh Smith: Get her… get her done.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Josh Smith: Get her done.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Josh Smith: Um, anyway, this is… so, the idea… and it would look much prettier than this, of course. Um, but, like, um…

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Josh Smith: That, like, your navigation is here.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Josh Smith: I was thinking, like, what if they're…

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Josh Smith: What if…

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Josh Smith: By default, they get into an experience where there's no left-hand navigation.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I mean, the way it's going right now, it doesn't seem like there will be any. Well, that's not true.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Josh Smith: Well, let's just say this.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Nik Patel: For the app, that won't be. I don't know how we want to handle that on the web.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Josh Smith: That there may be a navigation, but the navigation is no longer prominent.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Josh Smith: It's no longer, like, the…

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Nik Patel: Oh, like, in front of you, yeah, okay.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Josh Smith: It's no longer stealing your attention.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Josh Smith: Um, these are just thoughts. Um…

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Josh Smith: But that, um, it would be a similar concept here.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Josh Smith: Um, where…

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Josh Smith: It's talking to you.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and as I mentioned yesterday, uh, there are components, um.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Josh Smith: that… it…

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Josh Smith: There are components that…

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Josh Smith: are consistent throughout any kind of task. Um…

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Nik Patel: Uh-huh.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Josh Smith: This would be the task, it's the task name itself.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Josh Smith: So I'm trying to get these components together. There would be the concept of, um…

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Josh Smith: Navigation across these tasks.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Josh Smith: So I'm just gonna represent that here.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Josh Smith: There's the concept of the, um…

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Josh Smith: The John talking.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Nik Patel: Can I recommend something?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Nik Patel: So, what if we did it this way?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Nik Patel: I like the talk.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Nik Patel: The task, sure, like, you know, violators or whatnot.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Nik Patel: Move that, um, voice mode right below, um…

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Nik Patel: Where it says Execution Mode, and make it, like, a small line.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Josh Smith: This thing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Nik Patel: Right, but, like, keep the Execution mode at the bottom.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Josh Smith: Oh, okay.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Nik Patel: Actually, I should be able to do it. So what I'm saying was, um…

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Josh Smith: Do it.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Nik Patel: If this is here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Nik Patel: Basically, it's something like this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Nik Patel: And then this just basically… the whole need for it to exist goes away, which opens up a canvas for us to, like, show the things that we want to show, because that's where…

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Nik Patel: We should be paying attention.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Josh Smith: Yes, and in that sense, we could even move this thing, like…

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Josh Smith: This… this thing is still necessary, but it can kind of get in the way in desktop.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Nik Patel: Yep, let me show you what I'm thinking there. So…

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Josh Smith: Okay, it all exists in, like, um…

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Nik Patel: And change the… I don't know how to change the color here. Oh, here.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Josh Smith: Oh, that was it.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Nik Patel: Um…

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Josh Smith: I can change it for you.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Josh Smith: What do you want it?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Nik Patel: Just make anything, doesn't matter. Okay, so basically what it does is, um.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Nik Patel: when the user's talking, it would highlight that, and then waves. When the lens was talking, it would highlight that, and the waves.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Josh Smith: Alright, and then, uh, so I'm gonna do this too, um…

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Josh Smith: There'll be, it's not, it's not gonna look like this is gonna look prettier.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Josh Smith: But like a pretty downward arrow.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Josh Smith: Um, it's not gonna look like this, but…

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Josh Smith: And be like…

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Josh Smith: Focused on the one…

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Nik Patel: Well, the way I'm thinking about it, it would pulsate, right? That's how we know the art pulsating is how we know it's basically active.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Nik Patel: Also, we could do errors and stuff like that, that's fine. But all to say, that opens up a significant amount of screen asset for us, both desktop but mainly on the mobile, where we could show information that someone could see and say, like, oh, I know what you're talking about, I know what I'm talking about.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Josh Smith: Great. And the transcription of what they're saying, one after the other, could be, like, placed right above it, you think?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Nik Patel: Do we need transcription?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Nik Patel: If we do need transcription, we are taking, like, bottom half, and then we have the top half available.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Josh Smith: Okay… this is where, like, maybe on mobile you don't need transcription?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Josh Smith: I'll move it off, I'll de-scope it. Down the road, you're going to get requests for it, especially, um…

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Josh Smith: As you mentioned, like, when you're talking.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Josh Smith: Making sure that what you're saying is translated accurately, um…

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Nik Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Josh Smith: But I'll remove it for now.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Nik Patel: Okay.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Josh Smith: Okay, and in here…

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Josh Smith: Uh, yesterday, I was talking about how… was it yesterday or the day before? The day before. Talking about how it, like, would show stuff.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Josh Smith: And you were talking about this concept where, like, it, like, you could just show components on the page?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, um…

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Nik Patel: Sorry, I'm stuffing stuff in my mouth while I'm talking.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Josh Smith: Do your thing, do your thing.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Josh Smith: You gotta eat, you gotta take care of yourself.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Josh Smith: Thumbs up.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, I don't know, I did that.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Nik Patel: I'm just, uh, finding a link that can probably make it easy to understand what I'm saying.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Nik Patel: Yep, let me share my screen.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Nik Patel: Okay, so…

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Nik Patel: Alright, you see this thing? Actually, here, let me just put it here. So, uh, it's called, like, multi-stack Conversation Generative UI. It's a pretty good concept, in a way.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Nik Patel: So what it does is…

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Nik Patel: As you are, uh, streaming the data, generally it's just text, right?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Nik Patel: But there comes a time where, um, you are trying to do something and it's not just a text, you're showing the actual behavior.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Nik Patel: So, um, this is all easy stuff to do, but when it gets pretty interesting.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Nik Patel: Is something like this.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Nik Patel: I can't show it.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Nik Patel: So when you say, like, what is the weather in Tokyo?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Josh Smith: Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Nik Patel: it actually shows you this component. So what it does is it says, okay, now I need to show weather information.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Nik Patel: And it triggers weather component and renders the weather component on the fly.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Nik Patel: So, in our case, it could be, like.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Nik Patel: Text component, document component, calendar component, stuff like that.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Josh Smith: list component…

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, it can show that depending on the type of information we are expecting, yeah.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Josh Smith: time component.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Nik Patel: Now, I don't know how many types of components we'd have, but this is a great experience that I haven't seen anywhere.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Josh Smith: That would be cool.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Nik Patel: And the reason I think…

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Nik Patel: we might be able to do something like this, let me share, stop sharing, uh, is…

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Nik Patel: there are certain things that we know are going to be common. What times do I need to pick?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Nik Patel: What my calendar looks like, what are my meeting notes, uh, who are the people involved, like, some of those things.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Nik Patel: meeting briefs and stuff like that, we can start to put them in a…

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Nik Patel: In a way where it's much, much easier.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Nik Patel: Easier to deal with.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Nik Patel: So, anyway, yeah, that's… that's what I was thinking, um…

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Nik Patel: I think it might work out, we just need to know which ones we want, and then start with that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Nik Patel: Also, it's, uh… it's 3PM, just want to make sure you don't have to drop, or if you have to.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Josh Smith: Alright.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Josh Smith: Um, do you have to drop?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Nik Patel: Uh, in 2 minutes, or 5 minutes, maybe.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Josh Smith: Yeah, I have to drop in a couple minutes here. Alright, here's what I mentioned the other day, the kind of… whether or not you would want to flow like this, but the…

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Josh Smith: Here's what I'm seeing for this task, and all the pieces included. Did I get that right? Here's what I can do for you, thoughts?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Josh Smith: Here's an example of how I'd start out taking care of this. That's kind of like an if they want to just check, oh, that's how you're gonna write the email, okay.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Josh Smith: Um, the first email.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Josh Smith: Not every single email in the whole thing, just like, what's the first piece? Show me the first piece so I can get comfortable.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Josh Smith: And then, like, alright, I'm on it, anything else you'd like to share? Oh, good. Alright, on to the next thing. The idea of, like.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Josh Smith: if… are there 4 pieces to it? And can we break out, or are there X number of pieces, and can we break out those pieces? So, like, the first part is the, hey, what I'm seeing.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Josh Smith: You have a task. It's at this time, or in this date, so you could show the calendar… a calendar component and a time clock component, um…

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Josh Smith: It's with these people, and you could show, like.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Josh Smith: Like, the names of them in a list view, boom, boom, boom, boom, with their email addresses, and, like, to be able to say, like, um…

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Josh Smith: To be able to build those out, and to be like, okay.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Josh Smith: When they show a list of people, always show…

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Josh Smith: If they have it, name, position, email. Name, position, email, name, position, email, and then you can just design that component.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Josh Smith: Like, so, yeah, like, what are the most common chunks of information that come back?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Josh Smith: Don't, don't provide visuals for every single thing, just, like, what are the most common ones.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Josh Smith: Then get those, show those on the screen.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Josh Smith: ask, did I get it right or not? Um…

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Josh Smith: Um… if… and then allow them… allow the person to talk and to respond.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Josh Smith: Uh, and then the whole, here's what I can do for you, that's where, like, in the instance that I need to schedule time. Alright, well…

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Josh Smith: Here's the agenda.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Josh Smith: here's what… here's what I can do. I can coordinate this entire… I can coordinate finding this… the right time for you.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Josh Smith: Um, and so it could show the agenda, the stuff now that they're generating, because the first thing is, here's stuff that I've analyzed.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Josh Smith: The second is, here's stuff I've generated already, and stuff I'm going to generate.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Josh Smith: Um, you could even, like, squash… you could even squash 2 and 3 if you wanted to, and just have an example email, too.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Josh Smith: Here's what I can do for you. Um…

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Josh Smith: And then, um…

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Josh Smith: And then they say yes, and then the last thing is just, like, um…

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Josh Smith: Great! Anything else you'd like to share before I begin? Just, like, a last… a last…

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Josh Smith: A lasted, uh, opportunity and.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Josh Smith: Um…

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Josh Smith: And then once that's done, they move on to the next one.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Josh Smith: Oh, you're mute.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Nik Patel: One of the things we should build into this is when we show these components, give it action.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Nik Patel: approve, reject, yes, no, change, something like that. Because every time it approves, we know that we are getting good results, and we could use that behind the scene to say, these are.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Josh Smith: Oh, yeah.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Nik Patel: Good components for us to, like, get to a point where it's, like, you upload, like.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Nik Patel: Last 8 out of 8 and 10 times do you want us to go on auto?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Josh Smith: Oh…

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Nik Patel: we'll do that, like, we'll do that way out in future, but in the beginning, for now, it's just approve. We'll track that, and then worry about the…

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Nik Patel: Auto rule creation later.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Josh Smith: Makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. Um…

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Josh Smith: That makes a lot of sense. I was, uh, because I have been… I have been approaching concepting with you based on the…

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Josh Smith: target of folks who already have a high trust in AI.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Nik Patel: Yep.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Josh Smith: People who have low trust, you're right, they want to see and they want to prove over time before the AI says, oh.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Nik Patel: Hmm.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Josh Smith: We notice you're trusting this, you want us to take care of it for you, so yeah.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Nik Patel: Yeah, yeah, and right now, right, even when it comes up, even if they say, yeah, this looks good, send it, we'll essentially mark it as approved button clicked in itself, which gives us the data that we need behind the scene.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Nik Patel: What's working, what's not working, evaluations, stuff like that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Josh Smith: Makes sense. Cool. Does this help inch you a bit further this time?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Nik Patel: bit further, yeah, I think when we talk tomorrow, um, I want to see if we can take some examples, and then just go after… we took emails, we took some stuff, and like, yes, it's working, it's working.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Nik Patel: then I think we'll have a pretty good handle on the structure that screen needs to take, and then I can start to, like, save.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Nik Patel: Because this weekend, I want to build at least the Gmail flow of it, Gmail calendar, and say, alright, start to ingest, and then I want to show, like, what do I do with that ingestion, so this will really help.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Josh Smith: Okay.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Nik Patel: Alrighty. Thank you, appreciate it.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Josh Smith: Sure, we'll do… no problem, take care, man.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Nik Patel: You're going to see it.
