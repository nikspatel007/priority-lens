# Priority Lens - Product Vision

> "The hardest thing about any of this is not actually doing the task, or putting the task in the system... it's actually remembering that I have to put a task in a system. That's the thing that I want to solve for."

## What We're Building

Priority Lens is an AI-powered personal assistant called **Lenso** that helps busy professionals focus on what matters most. It proactively surfaces items that need attention and helps users make conscious decisions about their priorities.

## Core Problem

People are overwhelmed by:
- Multiple email accounts with hundreds of messages
- Projects across different areas (work, personal, business ventures)
- Tasks that fall through the cracks because no one is tracking them
- The mental load of trying to remember everything

**The real problem isn't doing tasks - it's knowing which tasks need attention.**

## How Priority Lens Solves This

### 1. Proactive Surfacing
AI analyzes incoming information (starting with email) and identifies:
- Items requiring action
- Follow-ups that have been missed
- Deadlines approaching
- Patterns and projects that need attention

### 2. Smart Grouping
Automatically organizes items by:
- Project (e.g., "Location 1 Opening", "Location 2 Opening")
- Common people involved
- Topic/subject matter
- Urgency level

### 3. Decision Framework
For every surfaced item, users get:
1. **What has come up** - Clear summary
2. **Context** - Background and history
3. **Information** - Attachments, related files
4. **Actions** - Concrete options to choose from

### 4. Conscious Decision Making
Users explicitly choose to:
- **Take action now** - Do it immediately
- **Review** - Look at details before deciding
- **Defer** - Schedule time, set reminder, or delegate

> "It's a problem, you are not paying attention to it, but you need to. Do you want to pay attention now, or do you want to schedule time and pay attention then?"

## Three Modes

### Execution Mode ("Get It Done")
- Focused task processing
- One item at a time (card-based UI)
- Swipe through tasks
- Take action or defer

### Prep Mode
- Planning and preparation
- Review upcoming items
- Set up for focused work sessions

### Eagle View (System View)
- High-level overview of all projects
- See what's being tracked
- Understand who's doing what
- Strategic perspective

## The Lenso Experience

### Voice-First Interface
- Conversational AI assistant
- Speak naturally to interact
- AI responds with serif typography (distinction from user input)

### Visual Design Principles
- Clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Minimal navigation (doesn't steal attention)
- Intentional use of color (mostly grayscale with purposeful accents)
- Professional and trustworthy appearance

### Personality
- Helpful but not pushy
- Knowledgeable without being preachy
- Respects user's time and decisions

## Target Users

Busy professionals managing:
- Multiple projects simultaneously
- Several email accounts
- Business ventures alongside employment
- Complex personal responsibilities

## Key Quotes from Brainstorming

On reducing stress:
> "Even if I can just see what's going on with this location vs that location... that in itself is like 50% stress gone."

On the value proposition:
> "I'm not going into this email inbox, I'm essentially getting work done. Or deciding not to get it done and pushing it, but it's a conscious decision."

On the framework:
> "Here's what has come up. Here's the context. Here's the information. Here's the action options, and here's your decision options."
