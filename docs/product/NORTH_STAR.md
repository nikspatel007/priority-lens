# Priority Lens North Star

> The vision we're building toward and how we'll know we've arrived.

## The Vision

### One Sentence
**Priority Lens is an AI-powered personal assistant that proactively surfaces what needs attention so busy professionals can focus on what matters most.**

### The Elevator Pitch
You have 500 unread emails across 3 accounts. A franchise opening in two weeks. A sales deck due tomorrow. Your spouse asked you to schedule a dinner. And somewhere in all that, someone's waiting on a follow-up you promised three days ago.

Priority Lens watches everything, surfaces what matters, and helps you make conscious decisions about your priorities. Not another inbox. Not another task list. A partner that remembers so you don't have to.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### The Real Problem
> "The hardest thing about any of this is not actually doing the task, or putting the task in the system. If I can put a task, then obviously it will remind me. That's not the hard part. It's actually remembering that I have to put a task in a system."

**Other tools say:** "Here's where you put your tasks."
**We say:** "Here's what you need to pay attention to."

### The Feeling We Eliminate
That nagging sense that you're forgetting something. The 3 AM wake-up wondering if you replied to that email. The meeting you walked into unprepared because no one reminded you.

### The Feeling We Create
> "Even if I can just see what's going on with this location vs that location... that in itself is like 50% stress gone."

Calm. Clarity. Confidence that nothing important is falling through the cracks.

## Our Differentiation

| Traditional Tools | Priority Lens |
|------------------|---------------|
| You create tasks | AI surfaces what needs attention |
| You organize | AI groups by project/topic |
| You remember to check | System proactively alerts |
| Task management | Decision facilitation |
| Inbox zero goal | Conscious prioritization |
| You hunt for info | Context delivered to you |
| Manual follow-ups | Automatic tracking |

### We Are Not
- An email client (even though we read email)
- A task manager (even though we track tasks)
- A calendar app (even though we schedule)
- A chatbot (even though you talk to us)

### We Are
- A proactive intelligence layer across your work
- A decision facilitator, not a decision maker
- A partner that never forgets
- The assistant you always wanted but couldn't afford

## The Experience

### Meet Lenso
Lenso is your AI assistant. Not a chatbot. A partner.

**Personality:**
- Helpful but not pushy
- Knowledgeable without being preachy
- Respects your time and decisions
- Speaks in serif (distinguished from UI)

**Behavior:**
- Comes to you with what matters
- Offers options, doesn't demand
- Learns your preferences over time
- Takes action when you trust it to

### The Three Modes

#### Execution Mode ("Get It Done")
The default experience. One item at a time. Here's what needs attention → Here's the context → Here's what I can do → Your decision. Next.

> "I'm not going into this email inbox, I'm essentially getting work done. Or deciding not to get it done and pushing it, but it's a conscious decision."

#### Prep Mode
What's coming up? What do you need to know before that meeting? What should you be thinking about this week?

#### Eagle View
The strategic perspective. All your projects. All your people. Everything that's being tracked. The bird's eye view of your work life.

### The Framework

For every surfaced item:
1. **What has come up** - Clear summary
2. **Context** - Background and history
3. **Information** - Attachments, related files
4. **Actions** - Concrete options
5. **Decision** - Take action now, review later, or defer

> "It's a problem, you are not paying attention to it, but you need to. Do you want to pay attention now, or do you want to schedule time and pay attention then?"

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**Time to first "wow" moment** - How quickly does a new user feel the value?

### Leading Indicators
- Items surfaced that user didn't know about
- Actions completed through voice (vs manual)
- Return rate (users coming back daily)
- Trust progression (review everything → auto-approve)

### The Real Test
> "If we can get 5 to 10 people addicted to the product, marketing will get much, much easier."

**Addiction signals:**
- Double-tap gesture becomes habit
- User feels anxious without daily check-in
- User recommends without being asked
- User expands to more email accounts/integrations

## Guiding Quotes

On the core value:
> "In pretty much 95% of cases... the issue has never been that we can't get the task done, or we don't know what to do. It's how do I get that in there so I know what my collective priorities look like?"

On the experience:
> "Here's what has come up. Here's the context. Here's the information. Here's the action options, and here's your decision options."

On voice-first:
> "I can think faster, I can talk faster than I can type. For a productivity app, that's worth it."

On trust:
> "The product should speak for itself. When it does, the sales portion is much easier."

On differentiation:
> "Now we are not even talking about emails or text, we are talking about work. A piece or unit of work that needs to get done, or that you need to know about."

## The Ultimate Vision

A world where:
- No one lies awake wondering if they forgot something
- AI handles the mundane so humans focus on meaning
- Work feels like winning, not spinning wheels
- Technology serves without demanding attention
- Everyone has the assistant that executives have always had

> "When you look at this icon, you should feel that sense of calm that you have got someone that can help you get out of this never-ending world of things."
